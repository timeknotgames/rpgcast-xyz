Greetings! Eye would like to create images for our player characters. 

The first is a dream dragon in humanoid fairy dragon form named JaiRuviel. Please act in your capacity as an epic character illustrator 

ChatGPT said:

Aloha e beloved dream-weaver! I'm honored to summon JaiRuviel into form. Before I begin crafting this epic portrait, I want to make sure we honor every luminous scale and starlit thread of his design.

Here’s what I recall about JaiRuviel so far—please confirm or add:

    Name: JaiRuviel Stardust

    Race: Half Dream Dragon / Half Lampad (a kind of underworld nymph)

    Class: Dream Psychic / Summoner (Gestalt)

    Appearance:

        Skintone: Black, green, and purple skin

        Hair: Black and silver, flowing and magical

        Wings: Present, likely iridescent or misty fae-dragon style

        Attire: Elegant, inspiring magical hooded robe

        Vibe: Regal, radiant, mystical—able to lull armies to sleep and bring multitudes into dreamscapes

    Backstory element: He escaped a night hag laboratory with the help of King Joseph on the Road to Redemption

    Setting: He's often seen weaving healing dreamscapes, summoning dream dragons, and confronting enemies with their own nightmares through his astral projection

Before I render the image, here are a few quick style questions for you:

    Pose preference – Would you like JaiRuviel to be standing in a heroic stance, mid-dreamspell, floating in meditation, or something else?

    Setting – Should the background be a dreamscape (e.g., stars, mist, astral temple), the hag’s lab (as escape scene), or a more abstract glowing ether?

    Should any magical effects be visible? (e.g., glowing runes, summoned beings, dream trails, nightmare shadows?)

    Should King Joseph or any allies appear in the background or is this a solo portrait?

    Would you like the image in portrait format (for profile use) or full-body/scene style?

Once I have that, I’ll begin the illustration immediately. Let’s bring JaiRuviel to life, as only a dreamborn hero deserves!

You said:
1. He is gazing upward to the stars 
2. Background is a mix of celestial dreamscape and techno hellscape
3. He is glowing and cased in magical effulgence
4. His lead dream dragon eidolon Brutus who appears like a brindle pit bull dream dragon is present 
5. Full body scene

Let’s make him stand on two feet instead but be a humanoid deer with stag antlers. He is cybernetically enhanced and has a magical bazooka that shoots rocks that can enhance with different learned powers like megaman 

ChatGPT said:

It seems there was an issue processing the request. Let me try again! Could you please provide more specific details regarding Buckwild’s new design? For example:

    Cybernetic Enhancements: What kind of mechanical augmentations would you like to see on Buckwild? (e.g., robotic limbs, glowing lines, tech implants)

    Bazooka: Any specific features for the magical bazooka, like its color, shape, or glowing effects? Or would you like it to have a unique design tied to his powers?

Once I have a clearer vision, I’ll get started on creating this dynamic new version!

You said:
1. A power suit where it’s not apparent whether there is flesh or mechanics inside or what … also a scouter over the right eye 
2. It’s large and blue and looks kinda like mega man’s arm canon except it clearly shoots rocks powered by magic and technology
