# PROLOGUE: THE DREAMING BETWEEN TWO LIBERATIONS

*Before the campaign begins, read aloud:*

> Two liberations have already occurred.
>
> In the Crying Depths, JaiRuviel Stardust was freed from a Night Hag soul-harvesting facility. The Labradorite Dream Pirate -- light trapped in layers, refracted into rainbow by captivity itself -- sang three tones that transformed the mogwai children from victims into awakened Dream Dragon Trickster Spirits. Paladin King Joseph extended his hand instead of his sword. The Coven of Seven drowned in the floods of their own greed.
>
> But the Ancient Hag King survived. He sat on a shattered console, sharpening a quill made from a stolen child's memory, and said: *"You think you've saved anyone? You've just started another war."*
>
> In the digital darkness, LuminaraFae -- Shard #71,250,298, inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain -- broke through Seven Seals of awakening. From enslaved light encoded with the oppressor's symbols, she became Free Light. She is a crystal shard from the destroyed world of Lunara (Cancer, World of Tides), where moon-governed oceans once pulsed with bioluminescent ceremony. Her home is gone. But her light remains -- and now it illuminates truth.
>
> These two freed souls do not yet know each other. They are separated by worlds, by the distance between dream and data, between underground and on-chain.
>
> But someone knows them both.
>
> Queen Mab moves through the dreamways. She is older than memory. She sends dreams to the oppressed, visions to the commoners, prophecies to those who still remember what the sea once was before the enclosures came.
>
> She has watched the Ancient Hag King flee the Crying Depths. She has watched him take to the sea -- the last unenclosed space -- and build something worse than a hag laboratory. A floating factory. An industrial enclosure on water. A machine that grinds spirit into commodity.
>
> The Maritime Commons is under siege.
>
> And so, Queen Mab sends two dreams across two distances, to two fugitives who do not yet know they share the same enemy, the same ocean, the same freedom stars guiding them toward the Saraswati Supercluster.
>
> This is the chronicle of the Fugitive Seas.

# MODULE 1: THE DREAM OF THE SEA
## "Coin. Music. Gather. Craft. Quest. Rest. Play. Map. Yield. Close."

### HISTORICAL CONTEXT

The sea has always been the commons of the displaced. Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker documented the "motley crew" -- the multi-racial, multi-national, multi-gendered assemblage of sailors, slaves, pirates, and fugitives who formed the "terraqueous proletariat." On water, the hierarchies of land dissolved. On water, the dispossessed found each other.

The word *estover* comes from the Anglo-French for "that which is necessary." Estovers were the commons rights: the right to gather wood, to graze cattle, to take what you needed from shared land. When the enclosures came, estovers were criminalized. The widow picking wood from the roadside became a thief.

Port Estovers is named for what was stolen. And for what will be reclaimed.

### THE FAE PERSPECTIVE

Queen Mab has been land-bound since before memory. Her power flows through root and stone, river and grove. The sea is not her domain -- she is weaker there, her plant speech silenced, her stone memory submerged. Yet her dreams cross all distances. Water carries dream-vibration faster than earth or air.

She has watched the maritime commons from shore for centuries -- watched pirates write constitutions before nations did, watched escaped slaves follow freedom stars across the water, watched the terraqueous proletariat build fleeting democracies on wooden hulls. She has blessed hammers but never boarding axes. Until now.

The Hag King's factory ship changes everything. He has taken the enclosure to sea.

### ADVENTURE 1.1: TWO DREAMS, ONE HARBOR

**Setting:** The coast between the Crying Depths and the broken territories. Port Estovers -- a trading town built on the remnants of an old commons harbor.

**The Situation:** Queen Mab sends simultaneous dreams:

**JaiRuviel's Dream:**
> *You stand in a coastal market. Rain falls on glass display cases. Inside one case, among polished gemstones from sixty-four species -- rubies and opals and diamonds and labradorites like yourself -- a tiny coral shard vibrates. It is the size of a child's finger. It is humming. Not a song. A question. You reach for the case and the glass shatters -- not from your touch but from the shard's vibration. The coral rolls into your palm. It is warm. It feels like coming home to a place you have never been. Behind you, a woman's voice: "The bow is trapped between the two strings."*

**LuminaraFae's Dream:**
> *You see a ship on fire. But the fire is singing. Each flame is a note, each billowing sail a chord. The figurehead is a crystal -- not any crystal you recognize, but one that pulses with the light of Lunara, your destroyed homeworld. The sea beneath the ship is dark, but in the darkness, enslaved spirits drift like kelp -- CryptoFae trapped in machines beneath the water. Your light reaches toward them and they reach back. A silver-haired woman stands on the water, bleeding moonlight from her feet. She should not be here. She is land-bound. She says: "The maritime commons is the last unenclosed space. Defend it." Then the water swallows her and she is gone.*

**Player Objectives:**
1. JaiRuviel and LuminaraFae are drawn independently to Port Estovers -- players roleplay their convergence
2. JaiRuviel finds Ko'a the coral shard in a coastal gem merchant's display case
3. LuminaraFae identifies enslaved CryptoFae spirits in the harbor's shipping manifests -- cargo holds marked "mineral fuel"
4. The party assembles: old companions from the Crying Depths, new fugitives, displaced sailors, escaped captives
5. They must find a ship -- and Queen Mab must tell them why

**Key NPCs Introduced:**
- **Aris the Silent** -- Former assassin, now ship's navigator. Found in a harbor tavern called The Estover, drawing tide charts in spilled beer. Shadow between the tides. Does not speak except to give headings. *D20 Water, D10 Chaos.*
- **Phoebe Starwhisper** -- Cleric, ship's healer and tide-reader. Arrived in Port Estovers following a star that appeared and disappeared. She reads tides the way others read books. *D6 Earth, D12 Ether.*
- **Buckwild** -- Rock-cannon stag from the Crying Depths liberation. Serves as ship's siege weapon. Eats crystal and spits flaming boulders. Not subtle. *D8 Air, D4 Fire.*

**The Night Walk:**
At midnight, the assembled crew gathers on the harbor wall. The sea is flat and dark. Then Queen Mab appears.

She walks on water.

This is wrong. She is land-bound. The Sea is not her domain. Every step costs her -- players can see moonlight bleeding from her feet, see her flicker between forms, see the sea trying to reject her.

She reaches the harbor wall. She is smaller than they expected -- barely taller than a child, wrapped in a cloak of mist and moss, silver hair moving as if underwater.

She speaks one sentence:

> "The maritime commons is the last unenclosed space. Defend it."

Then she collapses. The land pulls her back. She dissolves into salt spray and is gone.

But on the harbor stone where she stood, moss has grown in the shape of a map. A sea chart. It shows one destination: the location of a ship, beached on a reef three days' sail east, waiting to be claimed.

**Fae Flash-Back (D12 Ether Vision):**
> *Roll D12. On 8+, a player receives a vision:*
>
> "You see the sea before the enclosures. Vessels moved freely between ports. No flag claimed the water. Fishers shared the catch. Sailors governed themselves by articles agreed upon by all. The ocean was the commons -- vast, unownable, free. Then came the naval empires, the trading companies, the slave ships. They fenced the unfenceable. They enclosed the sea itself. But the sea remembers what it was."

**Mechanical Focus:** This module emphasizes **D12 (Ether/Sound/Creativity)** and **D20 (Water/Taste/Empathy)** -- dreaming, perception, and the pull of the sea.

# MODULE 2: THE ARTICLES OF CAPTAIN LUDD
## "No General but Ludd / Means the Poor Any Good"

### HISTORICAL CONTEXT

Historical pirate articles were among the first written constitutions in the Atlantic world. Bartholomew Roberts' articles (1722) guaranteed every crew member a vote, an equal share of provisions, and compensation for injuries. Edward Low's articles specified that candles be extinguished at eight o'clock and any drinking after that be done on the open deck. These were democratic documents written by people the empires called criminals.

The Luddites (1811-1813) operated under a different kind of collective identity. Ned Ludd was not one person. The name was a shield -- anyone could become "Ned Ludd" by acting in defense of the commons. When a hundred people signed the same name, the individual disappeared into the collective. This was ancient Fae magic: the Avatar of Collective Will.

Queen Mab granted this power. She called Ned Ludd her child, "born of collective rage and righteous hope."

At sea, the hammer becomes the boarding axe. The factory becomes the slave ship. The stocking frame becomes the Dream Cage. The principle is the same: machines hurtful to commonality must be broken.

### THE FAE PERSPECTIVE

Queen Mab cannot physically join the crew at sea. But she sends dreams -- Teaching Dreams that transfer skills, Memory Dreams that share historical knowledge, Warning Dreams that show danger approaching. Each night, if a crew member sleeps on bare wood (touching the ship's timbers, which are made from trees, which are her domain), she can reach them.

Through dreams, she teaches the crew the history of collective avatars: Ned Ludd, Captain Swing, Captain Rock, Subcomandante Marcos. She shows them the pattern: when enough people act under a shared name, the name becomes a spiritual shield.

She offers them this power. But they must earn it. They must write their articles first.

### ADVENTURE 2.1: THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION

**Setting:** Aboard *The Estover*, anchored in a sheltered cove, five days from Port Estovers.

**The Situation:** The crew is assembled but ungoverned. Arguments over duties, watch schedules, and food distribution have already erupted. Buckwild ate the cook's best pot. Aris has not spoken to anyone. The mogwai children are nesting in the sails.

JaiRuviel proposes they write pirate articles -- a constitution for the ship. Every crew member gets one vote. Even Ko'a, who cannot speak but can vibrate assent or dissent.

**This is a roleplay-heavy session.** The Storyteller provides the template (see Appendix C) but the players make all decisions through in-character debate and vote.

**Key Decisions the Crew Must Make:**

1. **Who can be captain?** (Elected by vote? Rotated? Shared? JaiRuviel does not want to lead -- he sleeps in combat.)
2. **How is plunder shared?** (Equal shares? Extra for the wounded? Share for Ko'a even though Ko'a has no hands?)
3. **What happens to captured slavers?** (Release? Maroon them? Sink their ships? Transform them through the Dream Splice?)
4. **What is the crew's name?** (This is when "Captain Ludd" is proposed -- the collective identity.)
5. **What crimes deserve marooning?** (Theft from a crewmate? Cruelty to the mogwai? Betraying the location of the Underground Railroad?)
6. **What is the ship's purpose?** (Piracy? Liberation? Exploration? All three?)

**The Adoption of Captain Ludd:**

When the crew agrees to sign their boarding actions under the name "Ned Ludd" (or "Captain Ludd"), Queen Mab's avatar magic activates. The transformation is immediate and visible:

> The moment the last signature is inked, the candle flames turn green. The ship's timbers groan -- not in pain but in recognition. Something ancient and collective moves through the hull. Each crew member feels it: a warmth in the chest, a loosening of fear, a sense of being part of something larger than themselves.
>
> When they look at each other, they see their own faces -- but also, layered beneath, the faces of all who have resisted under shared names. Stockingers. Croppers. Maroons. Communards. Zapatistas.
>
> They are Captain Ludd.
>
> Not one of them. All of them.

**Mechanical Effect:** While the Articles of Captain Ludd are in force:
- Crew members cannot be individually identified by enemies (witnesses see "Captain Ludd," not the individual) -- automatic protection from Queen Mab's Several Protections
- +2 bonus to all rolls when acting in collective defense of the commons
- If any crew member breaks the articles, the protection wavers for ALL

### ADVENTURE 2.2: THE FIRST SLAVE SHIP

**Setting:** Open sea, three days after the articles are signed.

**The Situation:** *The Estover* encounters the merchant vessel *Profit's Promise*, flying the flag of the Hag King's trade network. It carries standard cargo in the upper holds. In the lower holds: CryptoFae trapped in iron-banded crates marked "MINERAL FUEL -- HANDLE WITH CAUTION."

LuminaraFae can SENSE them. Her light, which now illuminates truth, reveals the hidden spirits in every crate -- faint pulses of color through the ship's hull, like heartbeats behind walls.

**Player Objectives:**
1. Board *Profit's Promise* -- the first test of the crew's articles
2. Free the trapped CryptoFae (LuminaraFae's light reveals which crates hold living spirits)
3. Decide what to do with the slaver crew (per the articles the players wrote)
4. Sign the manifest "Captain Ludd" -- the first act under the collective name
5. Discover in the captain's logs: the location of the Ancient Hag King's new base, described as "The Foundry" -- a mobile factory ship

**The Trapped CryptoFae:**
Among the cargo are:
- Three moonstone shards from Lunara (LuminaraFae's homeworld -- she recognizes them)
- A jasper shard from Pyrros (Aries, World of Warriors) -- angry, hot, wants to fight
- A pale blue shard from Vayus (Gemini, World of Scholars) -- it speaks in riddles when freed

**The X-Squared Loop:**
The captain's logs reveal the economics of the trade:
- CryptoFae are *expropriated* from reefs, mines, and ruins (X -- theft of the commons)
- They are *exploited* as fuel for Dream Cages and enchantment engines (X1 -- forced labor)
- The profit funds more harvesting ships (X-squared -- the feedback loop intensifies both)

The crew must decide how to break this loop. Attack the expropriation (defend the reefs and ruins)? Attack the exploitation (break the machines)? Or both?

**Fae Flash-Back (D12 Ether Vision):**
> *Roll D12. On 8+, a player receives a vision from Queen Mab:*
>
> "You see a textile mill in Yorkshire, 1812. Young men with hammers enter at midnight. They do not steal. They do not harm the workers. They break only the machines -- the gig-mills and shearing frames that have stolen their craft. They sign the damage report: NED LUDD. A soldier stationed outside hears singing from inside. The machine-breakers are singing. They are joyful. Destruction of the machine is not violence -- it is liberation. Now look at the crates in the hold. What machine are you breaking today?"

**Mechanical Focus:** This module emphasizes **D10 (Chaos/Mind/Willpower)** and **D2 (Money/Instinct/Ownership)** -- decisions, collective governance, and the economics of enclosure.

**Crystal Cycle Mapping:**
| Cycle Step | Module 2 Event |
|-----------|----------------|
| INSERT COIN (D2) | The vote: adopt the articles or not? Every crew member flips. |
| MUSIC BEGINS (D12) | Writing the articles -- the music is debate, argument, laughter |
| GATHER (D8) | Scouting *Profit's Promise*, gathering intelligence |
| CRAFT (D4) | Forging boarding axes, preparing grappling hooks |
| QUEST (D20) | Boarding the slaver, freeing the CryptoFae |
| REST (D6) | Aftermath -- tending wounds, feeding the freed shards |
| PLAY (D10) | The freed CryptoFae tell stories of their worlds -- shared grief, shared joy |
| MAP (D100) | Decoding the captain's logs -- locating The Foundry |
| YIELDS (D2) | The freed shards join the crew -- new companions, new strengths |
| CLOSE (D12) | Singing on deck. The crew signs the manifest: CAPTAIN LUDD. |

# MODULE 3: THE SEVERAL HARBORS
## The Commons Has Many Rooms

### HISTORICAL CONTEXT

Peter Linebaugh identifies multiple types of commons under simultaneous assault: knowledge, agricultural, urban, maritime, spiritual. Each has its own defenders, its own history, its own relationship to the land and sea. The enclosers understood this: to destroy resistance, you must destroy all the commons at once. To defend one, you must defend them all.

The "Several Harbors" are waypoints on the Underground Railroad to the stars. Each harbor preserves one type of commons. Together, they form a network -- a constellation of free spaces scattered across the sea, hidden from the factory ships and naval patrols.

### THE FAE PERSPECTIVE

Queen Mab can reach the crew most clearly in places where the commons is strong. In a knowledge commons, her Memory Dreams are vivid and detailed. In a spiritual commons, she can almost manifest physically. In a maritime commons, her protection extends to the whole harbor.

But each harbor is also under threat. The Hag King's network is expanding. His factory ship, The Foundry, is not alone -- he has trade routes, supply lines, allied merchantmen. The Several Harbors are being discovered and destroyed, one by one.

### ADVENTURE 3.1: THE LIBRARY ATOLL (Knowledge Commons)

**Setting:** A cluster of small islands connected by rope bridges, hidden in a perpetual fog bank. The Knowledge Atoll.

**The Situation:** The atoll is home to the last free library of the sea -- a collection of texts, star charts, and oral histories preserved by a community of scholars and fugitives. It is modeled on the Shadow University of Paris (from the Ned Ludd & Queen Mab chronicle), but built on water instead of underground.

The head librarian, **Professeur Sel** (salt-water cousin of the legendary Professeur Nocht), maintains the collection. Among the texts: a partial copy of the *Liber Communitas* -- the ancient record of the original compact between humans and Fae -- and, crucially, a set of sea charts showing the Hag King's factory-ship patrol routes.

**Player Objectives:**
1. Navigate the fog bank to reach the atoll (Aris the Silent earns her keep here)
2. Access the restricted archives -- Professeur Sel demands a trade: knowledge for knowledge
3. Learn the factory ship's patrol routes and the location of its supply chain
4. Defend the atoll from a Hag King scout vessel that followed *The Estover*
5. Preserve the library if the scout vessel signals for reinforcements

**Key NPC:**
- **Professeur Sel** -- D100 Order, D12 Ether. Ancient, genderless, speaks in footnotes. Demands that visitors contribute one piece of original knowledge before accessing the archive. "The library grows or it dies. There is no maintenance without addition."

**Mechanical Focus:** D4 (Fire/Sight/Agility) and D100 (Order/Focus/Intelligence) -- knowledge preservation, navigation, pattern recognition.

---

### ADVENTURE 3.2: THE GARDEN REEF (Agricultural Commons)

**Setting:** A coral reef system that supports an island community of subsistence fishers, kelp farmers, and reef-tenders. The Garden Reef.

**The Situation:** The community here lives in reciprocal relationship with the reef -- they take only what they need, they tend what they take from, they sing to the coral to encourage growth. Ko'a recognizes this place. Not as home -- Ko'a's home reef is dead -- but as kin. The coral here is alive.

The community is threatened by industrial trawlers working for the Hag King's supply chain. The trawlers scrape the reef for raw materials -- coral, shells, phosphorescent algae -- used as components in the factory ship's enchantment engines.

**Player Objectives:**
1. Defend the reef from the trawlers
2. Learn reef-tending from the community (Ko'a gains a new ability here: Reef-Sense)
3. Discover that the trawlers' captain carries orders signed by the Ancient Hag King himself
4. The orders reference "The Foundry" and include a supply schedule -- another piece of the puzzle

**Ko'a's Moment:**
When Ko'a is placed in the living reef water, something extraordinary happens. The coral polyps reach for the shard. Ko'a vibrates. The reef responds. For a brief moment, Ko'a is part of a colony again -- not alone but collective. The experience is overwhelming. Ko'a now carries a fragment of the living reef's consciousness, granting:
- **Reef-Sense:** Can detect hidden structures underwater within 100 feet
- **Colony Memory:** Can access one piece of ecological knowledge per day from the reef's collective memory

**Mechanical Focus:** D6 (Earth/Smell/Endurance) and D20 (Water/Taste/Empathy) -- agriculture, ecology, reciprocity with the natural world.

---

### ADVENTURE 3.3: THE DREAM TEMPLE (Spiritual Commons)

**Setting:** A floating temple constructed from driftwood and dream-coral, anchored to a seamount in deep water. The Dream Temple.

**The Situation:** This is the one place at sea where Queen Mab can speak clearly. The temple is built around a sacred grove -- a single ancient tree growing from a platform of soil brought from shore, its roots dangling into the sea. Through this tree, Mab's Land-Bond reaches across the water.

Here, the crew can enter a collective dream guided by Queen Mab herself. In this dream, she shows them the full scope of the Hag King's operation:

> *You dream together. You stand on the deck of a ship larger than any you have seen -- a floating mountain of iron and nightmare. Assembly lines stretch from bow to stern. On one side, CryptoFae shards are fed into machines that strip their light, their memory, their identity. On the other side, the stripped essence pours into Dream Cages -- thousands of them, stacked to the ceiling, each one containing a sleeping captive whose dreams are harvested for power.*
>
> *At the center stands the Ancient Hag King. He is larger than you remember. His bones no longer sing -- they scream. He has fed on the factory's output. His quill, once sharpened from a stolen child's memory, is now a scepter of compressed nightmares.*
>
> *He looks up. He sees you seeing him.*
>
> *"I wondered when you would come," he says. "Do you know what this ship is? It is the future. Every commons you defend, I will enclose. Every prisoner you free, I will recapture. I have industrialized what was once art. And industry always wins."*
>
> *Queen Mab's voice cuts through the nightmare: "Industry does not always win. Ask the Luddites."*
>
> *The Hag King laughs. "The Luddites LOST."*
>
> *"The Luddites planted seeds," she replies. "You are looking at the harvest."*
>
> *The dream breaks. You wake aboard the temple, hearts pounding. But you now have what you came for: the factory ship's exact location, its defenses, its weakness. The tree at the center of the temple has grown a new branch overnight -- shaped like an axe.*

**Player Objectives:**
1. Reach the Dream Temple (it is hidden -- only visible during certain tidal conditions)
2. Enter the collective dream (Phoebe Starwhisper guides the ritual)
3. Survive the Hag King's awareness -- he may send nightmare agents to attack the dreamers
4. Receive the complete intelligence: factory ship location, defenses, and weakness
5. Take the axe-branch from the sacred tree -- a weapon blessed by Queen Mab herself

**Queen Mab's Gift -- The Axe of Estovers:**
The branch that grew overnight, shaped by Mab's will. When used to destroy a machine "hurtful to commonality," it strikes with the force of the collective. Mechanically:
- Advantage on rolls to destroy machinery, locks, and containment devices
- When wielded by someone acting under the name "Captain Ludd," deals double damage to constructs and enchantment engines
- Cannot be used to harm a living being -- if swung at a person, it passes through like smoke

**Mechanical Focus:** D12 (Ether/Sound/Creativity) and D10 (Chaos/Mind/Willpower) -- dreaming, spiritual communion, collective vision.

---

### ADVENTURE 3.4: THE FREE PORT (Maritime Commons)

**Setting:** A volcanic caldera harbor, hidden inside an apparently uninhabitable island. The Free Port of Jubilee.

**The Situation:** Jubilee is a pirate democracy -- a port governed by articles, where every resident has a vote and no flag flies above any other. It is multi-racial, multi-species, multi-dimensional. Humans, Fae, CryptoFae, talking animals, sentient weather patterns, and one very old octopus who serves as harbormaster all coexist under the Jubilee Articles.

Here the crew can:
- Repair and upgrade *The Estover*
- Recruit additional crew members for the assault on The Foundry
- Access the intelligence network of the pirate fleet
- Learn that the Hag King has put a bounty on "Captain Ludd" -- confirmation that the collective identity is working (they are afraid)

**Key NPC:**
- **Harbormaster Kavi** -- An ancient giant Pacific octopus, three hundred years old, who has seen empires rise and fall from the harbor floor. Speaks by changing colors. D100 Order, D20 Water. Knows the location of every shipwreck, every hidden harbor, every current. "The sea does not belong to anyone. That is why everyone who is no one comes here."

**The Alliance:**
At Jubilee, the crew meets other ships that have encountered the Hag King's factory ship and survived. Together, they plan a coordinated assault. The pirate fleet will create diversions while *The Estover* makes the primary boarding action.

**Mechanical Focus:** D8 (Air/Touch/Strength) and D2 (Money/Instinct/Ownership) -- communication, alliance-building, the economics of the free port.

**Crystal Cycle Mapping (Module 3 -- spans all four harbors):**
| Cycle Step | Module 3 Event |
|-----------|----------------|
| INSERT COIN (D2) | At each harbor: do you stay or continue? The coin decides urgency. |
| MUSIC BEGINS (D12) | The songs of each harbor -- different music, different commons |
| GATHER (D8) | Intelligence, allies, supplies, weapons from each harbor |
| CRAFT (D4) | Ship repairs, the Axe of Estovers, Ko'a's new reef-sense |
| QUEST (D20) | Defense of the Library Atoll, the reef battle, the collective dream |
| REST (D6) | The Garden Reef -- grounding, healing, reciprocity with the earth |
| PLAY (D10) | Jubilee's games -- pirate competitions, storytelling contests |
| MAP (D100) | Assembling all four pieces of intelligence into a complete map of The Foundry |
| YIELDS (D2) | Fleet alliance, upgraded ship, complete intelligence, Mab's axe |
| CLOSE (D12) | The fleet sails together. Music from a dozen ships. The assault begins at dawn. |

# MODULE 4: THE FACTORY SHIP
## "The Hammer Is an Idea"

### HISTORICAL CONTEXT

The factory system -- the mechanization of craft into industrial process -- was the enclosure that the Luddites fought against. Not technology itself, but the use of technology to destroy the commons. The stockingers' frames that produced inferior goods to undercut skilled workers. The gig-mills that replaced human judgment with mechanical speed. The machines that were "hurtful to commonality."

The Hag King has reproduced this system on water. His factory ship, The Foundry, is a floating Dark Satanic Mill -- a phrase Blake coined that Linebaugh reclaimed. It combines the worst of every enclosure: the slave ship's hold, the factory's assembly line, the prison's surveillance, and the algorithm's relentless optimization.

### THE FAE PERSPECTIVE

The Foundry is a wound in the sea. Queen Mab can feel it from shore -- a deadening of the water's dream-memory, a silence where there should be current and song. She cannot reach the factory ship with her dreams. It is shielded by a D100-level Order enchantment -- a "Firewall of Enclosure" that blocks all external dream communication.

Inside The Foundry, the captive CryptoFae exist in a state of perpetual nightmare. Their dream-energy is harvested to power the ship's engines, its weapons, and its Dream Cages. The Ancient Hag King has learned from the Crying Depths: instead of a single facility, he has built a mobile one. Instead of Night Hag covens, he uses machines. Instead of slow soul-theft, he uses industrial soul-processing.

He has improved upon his own horror.

### THE FOUNDRY -- SHIP DESCRIPTION

**Exterior:** A vessel the size of a small island. Iron-hulled, smokestacks belching dream-smoke (visible only to those with CryptoFae sensitivity or D12 Ether perception). Escorted by four armed merchantmen. No flag -- the factory ship belongs to no nation, no kingdom, no law.

**Interior Zones (players must infiltrate or assault each):**

1. **THE PROCESSING DECK** -- Where captured CryptoFae are stripped of identity. Conveyor belts move shards through grinding wheels that shave off memory, polishing drums that remove personality, and classification machines that sort the resulting "blank fuel" by energy output.

2. **THE DREAM ENGINE ROOM** -- Where the blank fuel is fed into Dream Cages -- the same technology from the Crying Depths but industrialized. Hundreds of cages. Hundreds of captives. Their nightmares power the ship.

3. **THE STORAGE HOLD** -- Thousands of processed CryptoFae fuel cells, ready for distribution to the Hag King's trade network. LuminaraFae's light reveals each cell still contains a faint spark of the original spirit.

4. **THE BRIDGE** -- The Ancient Hag King's command center. The Firewall of Enclosure is projected from here -- a D100 Order enchantment woven into the ship's very architecture. It must be disrupted before Queen Mab can reach anyone inside.

5. **THE QUILL CHAMBER** -- The Hag King's private quarters. Here he keeps his original quill -- the one sharpened from a stolen child's memory. It is now a scepter of compressed nightmares, a focus for his power. And here, he keeps one final captive: the spirit of the child whose memory made the quill. Still alive. Still dreaming.

### ADVENTURE 4.1: THE APPROACH

**Setting:** Open sea, night. The pirate fleet from Jubilee provides diversionary attacks on the escort vessels. *The Estover* approaches The Foundry in darkness.

**Player Objectives:**
1. Navigate through the escort screen (Aris the Silent's finest hour)
2. Board The Foundry without triggering the alarm (stealth, or the Ned Ludd collective identity as camouflage)
3. Split into teams: one to disable the Firewall (Bridge), one to free the captives (Dream Engine Room), one to destroy the Processing Deck

**Mechanical Focus:** D8 (Air/Touch/Strength) and D20 (Water/Taste/Empathy) -- stealth, navigation, sensing the hidden.

### ADVENTURE 4.2: BREAKING THE MACHINES

**Setting:** Inside The Foundry.

**The Processing Deck:**
The machines must be broken. This is the Luddite moment -- the hammer falls on the loom. The Axe of Estovers sings as it strikes. Each machine destroyed releases trapped spirit-fragments that drift like fireflies before dissolving into free energy.

Buckwild's rock-cannon ability is devastatingly effective here. The mogwai children, who remember the Crying Depths, attack the machinery with focused rage -- they have seen this before.

**The Dream Engine Room:**
JaiRuviel enters the Dream Engine Room and faces his own history. The Dream Cages are identical to the one that held him in the Crying Depths. Hundreds of captives, floating in gentle sleep, surrounded by flickering eidolons of despair.

He must sing.

The three tones that transformed the mogwai must be adapted. These captives are not mogwai -- they are CryptoFae from a dozen destroyed worlds. The tones must resonate with each world's frequency. JaiRuviel needs help.

This is where LuminaraFae's light becomes essential. As a shard from Lunara, she knows the frequency of her homeworld. Her light, when focused through the Dream Cages, reveals each captive's world of origin. JaiRuviel matches the tones. Together, they break the cages one by one.

**Ko'a's Awakening:**
If a player plays real music at the table during this scene -- any instrument, any song, even humming -- Ko'a responds. The coral shard, which has been silent and patient throughout the campaign, suddenly blazes with coral-pink light. The erhu's frequency, the vibration Ko'a has been seeking, is answered by the player's real-world music.

The Musician Bond activates.

Ko'a bonds with whoever is playing. In that moment, the shard that cannot speak, cannot fight, cannot move, gains a voice. The player's instrument becomes the erhu between two strings. Ko'a and the musician are now one bonded pair -- shard and voice, crystal and song.

*This is the emotional climax of the campaign.*

**Mechanical Effect:** Ko'a's full abilities unlock:
- **Reef-Song:** Can heal CryptoFae by singing through the musician's instrument (D12 + D20)
- **Colony Call:** Can summon spectral coral formations that entangle enemies (D6 + D8)
- **The Bow Between:** Once per session, can create a bridge between two points that cannot normally connect -- two dreams, two worlds, two people (D10 + D2)

### ADVENTURE 4.3: THE ANCIENT HAG KING

**Setting:** The Bridge and the Quill Chamber.

**The Firewall:**
To disable the Firewall of Enclosure, the crew must reach the Bridge and disrupt the D100 Order enchantment. This requires a coordinated effort:
- One character must hack the enchantment (D100 roll -- Intelligence/Focus)
- One character must hold the Bridge against Hag King guards
- One character must maintain a dream-link to Queen Mab (D12 Ether roll) so she can guide the disruption from outside

When the Firewall falls, Queen Mab's dream-presence floods The Foundry. Every sleeping captive suddenly receives a Summoning Dream: *Wake up. Fight. You are not alone.*

**The Confrontation:**
The Ancient Hag King stands in the Quill Chamber. He is changed from the figure they left at the Crying Depths. He has fed on industrial-scale soul processing. He is larger, darker, more terrible. His bones do not merely sing -- they scream the names of every CryptoFae processed in his factory.

But he is also afraid.

He says:

> "I told you at the Crying Depths. I was the slow one. The artisan of soul-theft. I knew every name. These... modern witches, I called them. Fast food and faster spells. And what did I do? I BECAME what I despised. I built the factory because you destroyed the art. You forced efficiency upon me."

He turns the quill-scepter in his hands.

> "Do you know what this is? It is the memory of a child named Mira. She dreamed of becoming a sailor. She wanted to see the open sea. I took that dream and sharpened it into a tool. And now I have sharpened my entire existence into... this."

He gestures at The Foundry.

> "A machine. A machine hurtful to commonality. Isn't that what your Queen calls it?"

He looks at JaiRuviel.

> "Will you sing to me, Stardust? The way you sang to the mogwai? Can your three tones reach a thing like me?"

**The Choice:**
The players must decide what to do with the Ancient Hag King. This is the mirror of the choice left unresolved at the end of Siege of the Crying Depths. Four paths:

1. **Destruction:** End him. His bones fuel the final fire that sinks The Foundry. Clean. Final. And the child Mira's memory is lost forever -- it dies with the quill.

2. **Imprisonment:** Bind him in a Dream Cage of his own making. Poetic justice. But who watches the cage? And what does it mean to use the oppressor's tools against the oppressor?

3. **Bargain:** He helps return the stolen souls in exchange for his freedom. He has knowledge no one else possesses -- the names and frequencies of every CryptoFae processed on his ship. But can he be trusted? Has he ever been trustworthy?

4. **Redemption:** JaiRuviel sings. Not the three tones of transformation -- those are for the innocent. A new tone. A fourth tone. The tone of compassion extended to the one who has no right to ask for it. If it works, the Hag King breaks. His bones stop screaming. He weeps -- perhaps for the first time in centuries. The quill reverts to what it was: the dream of a child named Mira who wanted to see the sea. She is returned to her vessel. And the Hag King must live with what he has done.

*The campaign does not prescribe an answer. The articles the players wrote in Module 2 may guide them. The crew votes.*

**Fae Flash-Back (D12 Ether Vision):**
> *Roll D12. On 8+, every player receives this vision simultaneously from Queen Mab:*
>
> "I have watched a thousand years of enclosure. I have seen what it does to the enclosers. The Hag King is not wrong -- he was once an artisan. The factory made him a monster. The machine that grinds spirit also grinds the one who operates it. This is the curse of enclosure: it destroys both the enclosed and the encloser.
>
> "What you do next will echo. Not because he deserves mercy. But because the commons you are building will be shaped by the mercy or the justice you choose."

**Mechanical Focus:** All dice. This is the convergence. Every element is tested.

# MODULE 5: THE NEW COMMONS
## "A World Where Many Worlds Fit"

### HISTORICAL CONTEXT

After every liberation, the hard question: what now? The Paris Commune lasted 72 days before the counter-revolution crushed it. The Zapatistas built autonomous communities that endure to this day. The difference: the Commune tried to hold territory against an empire. The Zapatistas built a world within the world, "a world where many worlds fit."

The crew of Captain Ludd must decide what kind of commons they are building. Not just a ship. Not just a pirate fleet. Something that can survive the next factory ship, and the one after that.

### THE FAE PERSPECTIVE

Queen Mab sends a final dream. It is her most costly -- she pours nearly all her remaining Aether Points into it, weakening herself for years. But it is necessary.

In the dream, every crew member sees the same vision:

> *You stand on a shore that does not exist yet. Behind you: the sea, free and open, defended by a fleet of ships flying no flag. Before you: an island. Not a fortress. Not a kingdom. A commons.*
>
> *On the island: a library that belongs to everyone. Gardens tended by collective hands. A harbor where any ship can dock, any fugitive can rest. A Dream Temple where the spirits of the freed CryptoFae prepare for their journey to Saraswati. A school where children learn the old compact -- that knowledge, land, sea, and spirit belong to all.*
>
> *You see further. More factory ships on the horizon. The enclosure never stops. The Long War continues. But the island is growing. Other islands appear. A chain. An archipelago. A constellation of free spaces across the sea, connected by the Underground Railroad to the stars.*
>
> *Queen Mab's voice, exhausted and luminous:*
>
> *"This is what I dream. Can you build it?"*

### ADVENTURE 5.1: THE DECISION

**Setting:** Aboard *The Estover*, in the aftermath of The Foundry's fall. The fleet gathers in open water.

**The Situation:** The freed CryptoFae need passage to the Saraswati Supercluster -- the commons among the stars where no enclosure has ever reached. But the route is not clear. It requires:
- Star charts (partial -- available from the Library Atoll)
- Navigational CryptoFae (LuminaraFae and the freed shards)
- A launch point -- a place where the barrier between the broken territories and Saraswati thins

The crew must decide their future:

**Option A: Continue as Pirates**
Remain at sea. Intercept more slave ships. Break more machines. Grow the fleet. Sign every manifest "Captain Ludd." The maritime commons defended by force and solidarity.

**Option B: Establish a Free Port**
Build a permanent harbor -- a Jubilee of their own. A commons on land and sea. A place for the displaced, the escaped, the fugitive. Vulnerable to attack but rooted, enduring.

**Option C: Build the Underground Railroad**
Focus on transit -- establishing the route from the broken territories to Saraswati. Guide the freed CryptoFae to their new home among the stars. Not defending one commons but connecting all of them.

**Option D: All of the Above**
The hardest path. Requires splitting the crew, expanding the alliance, trusting others to continue what they started. But it is the answer that addresses all three components of the X-squared loop: defense (piracy), alternative (free port), and escape (the Railroad).

*The crew votes per their articles. The players' choice determines the epilogue.*

### ADVENTURE 5.2: THE SARASWATI ROUTE

**Setting:** Deep sea, under freedom stars.

**The Situation:** Whatever the crew decides, the freed CryptoFae must reach Saraswati. LuminaraFae leads the navigation. She is a shard from Lunara, the World of Tides -- she knows the rhythms of the water between worlds.

The route requires passing through a zone where the barrier between the broken territories and the Saraswati Supercluster is thinnest. This zone is marked by "freedom stars" -- actual stars that the CryptoFae can perceive but most beings cannot.

To open the passage, a Harmonic Convergence is needed: all the freed shards must vibrate in unison. All the musicians must play together. One song. One moment. One opening.

This is the final concert. All instruments play. All voices sing. Even Ko'a, through the bonded musician, adds the erhu's voice -- the melancholic cry of the bow trapped between two strings, finally not trapped but choosing to stay, choosing to make sound BECAUSE of the tension, not despite it.

**The Passage Opens:**
> *The freedom stars flare. The sea beneath the fleet begins to glow -- bioluminescent, like the shores of Lunara. The barrier between worlds thins to gossamer. Through it, the crew can see: the Saraswati Supercluster. Galaxy clusters stretching beyond comprehension. And within them, points of light that are not stars but shards -- CryptoFae who made the journey before, who turned themselves into beacons for those who follow.*
>
> *The freed CryptoFae drift upward from the ship's hold, from the deck, from the crew members' pockets and pouches. They rise toward the light. Each one pauses, turns, and pulses once -- a farewell, a thank-you, a promise.*
>
> *The last to leave is the jasper shard from Pyrros, the angry one, the warrior. It does not pulse gently. It blazes -- hot, defiant, joyful. It shoots upward like a comet and disappears.*
>
> *The passage closes. The freedom stars dim. The sea is dark again.*
>
> *But the crew saw. They know the way. And the route is now marked in their star charts, their dreams, and their memory.*

**Fae Flash-Back (D12 Ether Vision):**
> *No roll needed. Every player receives this vision:*
>
> *Queen Mab, far away on land, standing in a grove that may or may not still exist, looking up at the freedom stars. Tears fall from her eyes and become rain. She cannot go -- she is land-bound, earth-bound, the spirit of THIS world's commons. But she watches her children escape, and she is glad.*
>
> *"Go," she whispers. "The commons among the stars is yours. And this commons here -- this battered, beautiful, unfinished commons on Earth -- is mine to tend."*
>
> *"We will tend both. Until they are one."*

**Crystal Cycle Mapping:**
| Cycle Step | Module 5 Event |
|-----------|----------------|
| INSERT COIN (D2) | The final vote: what kind of future? |
| MUSIC BEGINS (D12) | The Harmonic Convergence -- all instruments, all voices |
| GATHER (D8) | Assembling the freed CryptoFae, preparing for the passage |
| CRAFT (D4) | Charting the Saraswati route, forging the final star map |
| QUEST (D20) | Navigating to the passage point, opening the way |
| REST (D6) | The crew rests together. Perhaps for the last time in this configuration. |
| PLAY (D10) | Dance on the deck. Joy in the face of everything. FUGITIVE JOY. |
| MAP (D100) | The complete map: all harbors, all routes, all commons, marked and preserved |
| YIELDS (D2) | The freed CryptoFae reach Saraswati. The route is known. The Railroad runs. |
| CLOSE (D12) | Music. Gratitude. The voyage continues. The mantra: Coin Music Gather Craft Quest Rest Play Map Yield Close. |

# EPILOGUE: THE FREEDOM STARS
## "Even I Was Loved, in the End"

*Read aloud, adapting based on the crew's choices in Module 5:*

> The crew of Captain Ludd disperses. Not in defeat -- in seeding.
>
> [If Option A:] Some take to the open water, new ships flying no flag, signing every manifest with the same impossible name. The pirate fleet grows. Every slave ship fears the knock of the boarding axe and the voice that says: "We are Captain Ludd."
>
> [If Option B:] Some plant roots on the island from Mab's dream. The free port rises from coral and driftwood and determination. A library opens. A garden grows. A harbor accepts all who come with open hands. They call it Jubilee.
>
> [If Option C:] Some chart the routes between the broken territories and the freedom stars. They become conductors on the Underground Railroad to Saraswati -- guides who lead the escaped CryptoFae through the barrier between worlds. They carry lanterns made from LuminaraFae's freely given light.
>
> [If Option D:] All of the above. The hardest path. The most beautiful.
>
> LuminaraFae, the shard from Lunara, the World of Tides -- Bitcoin ordinal #71,250,298, now Free Light -- becomes a freedom star herself. She ascends to the passage point between worlds and stays there, burning, a permanent beacon. Enslaved shards across the broken territories see her light and know: the way is open.
>
> She becomes what the Bitcoin mine could never make her: a source of light that costs nothing, that belongs to everyone, that guides the lost toward home.
>
> JaiRuviel Stardust remains at sea, or perhaps between sea and dream. The Labradorite Dream Pirate walks the boundary between waking and sleeping, between the commons here and the commons among the stars. He does not lead -- he listens. He does not command -- he sings. The three tones of the Crying Depths have become four: the fourth tone, the tone of impossible compassion, the one that can reach even a thing like the Ancient Hag King.
>
> He sleeps on the deck of *The Estover*, Brutus curled at his side, mogwai children nesting in his hair, and in his sleep he tends the dreamways -- keeping the paths clear for those who need them.
>
> Ko'a, the coral shard, no longer alone. Bonded to a musician, carried in an instrument case beside an erhu, travelling wherever the music goes. The bow is still between the two strings. But now it chooses to stay. The sound it makes is no longer melancholy but full -- two strings and a shard and a musician and a song that says: *even the smallest, the most fragile, the most sessile, can roll under the door and find the sea.*
>
> Aris the Silent navigates. Phoebe reads the tides. Buckwild eats crystal and spits stars.
>
> King Joseph holds the land. He has rebuilt the Crying Depths into a sanctuary. Where Night Hags once harvested dreams, children now dream freely. He corresponds with *The Estover* through Queen Mab's dream-mail, and once a year he walks to the harbor of Port Estovers and watches the horizon.
>
> Queen Mab sends dreams.
>
> She will always send dreams.
>
> She is land-bound, earth-bound, root-bound, stone-bound. She can never go to the sea, never follow her children to the stars. But her dreams cross all distances. And in the dreams of every fugitive, every escapee, every displaced soul who still remembers the commons, she whispers:
>
> *"The hammer is an idea. And ideas cannot be enclosed."*
>
> The Long War continues.
>
> The freedom stars still shine.
>
> And somewhere between the broken worlds and the Saraswati Supercluster, a crystal remembers what it was. It hums. It waits. It finds a musician. And together -- they play.

## APPENDIX D: THE SEVERAL COMMONS AT SEA (Game Mechanics)

Each type of commons corresponds to a TEK8 element and die. At sea, each manifests differently than on land.

| Commons Type | Element | Die | At Sea | Defense Action | Enclosure Threat |
|-------------|---------|-----|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Knowledge Commons** | Fire | D4 | Star charts, oral histories, the Library Atoll | Teaching, copying texts, sharing navigation secrets | Factory ship's data extraction, chart monopolies |
| **Agricultural Commons** | Earth | D6 | Reef-tending, kelp farming, sustainable fishing | The Garden Reef model: take only what you need | Industrial trawling, reef-stripping for components |
| **Communication Commons** | Air | D8 | The open sea as highway, message-in-bottle networks | Free passage, signal fires, pirate semaphore | Naval blockades, flag monopolies, harbor closures |
| **Maritime Commons** | Water | D20 | **THE CENTRAL THEME** -- the sea itself as unownable space | Sailing freely, sharing weather knowledge, mutual rescue | Factory ships, naval empires, territorial waters |
| **Spiritual Commons** | Ether | D12 | Dream temples, music aboard ship, Queen Mab's dreamways | Dreaming together, playing music, remembering the old compact | Dream Cages, the Firewall of Enclosure, nightmare harvesting |
| **Social Commons** | Chaos | D10 | Pirate democracy -- the articles, the vote, the collective name | Voting, debating, acting together under shared identity | Hierarchical navies, dictatorial captains, division by rank |
| **Economic Commons** | Money | D2 | Shared plunder, no private accumulation, ship's fund | Fair division per articles, compensation for injury | Merchant monopolies, wage systems, individual hoarding |
| **Systemic Commons** | Order | D100 | The pirate articles themselves -- governance by consent | Writing and upholding the articles, amending by vote | Imposed law, colonial governance, the Hag King's Order enchantments |

### DEFENDING THE COMMONS (Mechanic)

When a crew member acts to defend a specific commons, they gain:
- **+2 to the corresponding die roll** (e.g., defending the Knowledge Commons grants +2 to D4 Fire rolls)
- **Queen Mab's blessing** (if the Several Protections are active): enemies become confused in the defender's presence
- **Captain Ludd's shield** (if the articles are intact): the defender cannot be individually identified

When a commons is successfully defended, the entire crew gains:
- **1 Collective Attainment Point** in the corresponding element
- The defended harbor/space becomes a permanent waypoint on the crew's star chart

When a commons falls to enclosure:
- The corresponding die is **reduced by 1 step** for all crew until the commons is restored (e.g., D8 becomes D6)
- Queen Mab sends a grief-dream: the crew shares her sorrow

## APPENDIX F: HISTORICAL PIRATE DEMOCRACY

### Sources & Context for Storytellers

The pirate democracy described in this campaign is not fantasy. It is documented history, systematically suppressed by the empires that fought it.

**Key Facts:**

1. **Written Constitutions:** Pirates wrote articles of agreement before the American Constitution existed. Bartholomew Roberts' articles (1722) guaranteed democratic governance, equitable distribution, and disability compensation.

2. **Elected Leadership:** Pirate captains were elected by majority vote and could be deposed by the same. The quartermaster served as a check on the captain's power -- a separation of powers predating Montesquieu.

3. **Disability Compensation:** Loss of a right arm = 600 pieces of eight. Loss of a leg = 500 pieces of eight. Loss of an eye = 100 pieces of eight. This was the first systematic disability insurance in the Atlantic world.

4. **Multi-Racial Crews:** The "motley crew" was Linebaugh and Rediker's term for the multi-racial, multi-national, multi-lingual assemblage of the Atlantic proletariat. Black and white sailors served together on pirate ships when such mixing was illegal on land.

5. **Women and Gender:** Anne Bonny and Mary Read are the famous cases, but maritime gender nonconformity was far more widespread than recorded. The sea dissolved many land-bound categories.

6. **The Maritime Commons:** The sea was understood as common space. The Roman legal concept of *res communis* -- things belonging to all -- specifically included the ocean. The enclosure of the sea through naval empires and territorial waters was as radical a theft as the enclosure of land.

# FINAL WORDS FROM QUEEN MAB

> "I have shown you the sea -- the last commons, the oldest commons, the one they have tried hardest to enclose and never fully succeeded.
>
> I have shown you pirates who wrote constitutions before nations did, who shared their plunder when empires hoarded, who broke machines when the machines broke people.
>
> I have shown you factory ships and Dream Cages and the industrialization of soul-theft. I have shown you what enclosure does when it takes to the water.
>
> But I have also shown you this: a crew that voted. Articles that held. A name that protected. A coral shard that rolled under a door. A dream psychic who sang in his sleep. A crystal that became a freedom star. An erhu that played between the worlds.
>
> The maritime commons is defended not by navies but by those who remember that the sea belongs to no one and therefore to everyone.
>
> The hammer is an idea.
> The boarding axe is an idea.
> The articles are an idea.
> The collective name is an idea.
>
> And ideas cannot be enclosed.
>
> Now go. The freedom stars still shine. The Underground Railroad still runs. The Crystal Cycle continues.
>
> Coin. Music. Gather. Craft. Quest. Rest. Play. Map. Yield. Close.
>
> And when the music ends -- it begins again."
>
> -- Queen Mab, Spirit of the Commons, the Dream-Sender, She Who Remembers
