# The Genesis Council of Gemstone Species
## A Seven-Lens Critique & Formative Placement Framework
### Dice Godz / TEK8 / Quillverse — v1.0

> *"The stone does not belong to the one who names it. It belongs to the earth
> that bore it, the water that shaped it, the people who knew it first."*

---

## PREAMBLE

This document records the proceedings of a simulated **Genesis Council** —
seven scholarly and traditional perspectives convened to critique, refine, and
sanctify the initial v1.0 placement of 64 gemstone species across the 8
elemental petals of the Dice Godz system.

The v1.0 placement (recorded in `DICE_GODZ_64_GEMSTONE_SPECIES_v1.0.md`) was
made by intuitive mineral resonance. These seven lenses now examine that
intuition against documented traditions, scientific evidence, and lived
cultural knowledge.

**The Seven Council Seats:**
1. The Ratna Shastra (Vedic/Jyotish)
2. The Classical Naturalists (Theophrastus & Pliny)
3. The Abbess (Hildegard von Bingen & Medieval Lapidary)
4. The Crystallographer (Scientific Mineralogy)
5. The Pounamu Carver (Polynesian/Pacific)
6. The Turquoise Keeper (Indigenous Americas)
7. The Earth Steward (Biodynamic Agriculture & Gardening Traditions)

### Critique

The Navaratna (Nine Gems) system maps gems to the nine celestial bodies
(*navagrahas*). The v1.0 placement must be examined against these ancient
correspondences:

| Graha (Planet) | Navaratna Gem | v1.0 Placement | Alignment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Surya (Sun) | **Ruby** (Padmaraga) | Fire | CONFIRMED — Sun governs fire and vitality |
| Chandra (Moon) | **Pearl** (Mukta) | Water | CONFIRMED — Moon governs tides and emotions |
| Mangala (Mars) | **Red Coral** (Vidruma) | *Not included* | NOTED — Coral is absent from the 64 |
| Budha (Mercury) | **Emerald** (Marakata) | Earth | CONTESTED — Mercury governs communication (Air?), but Jyotish assigns Mercury to Wednesday, the "green" day |
| Brihaspati (Jupiter) | **Yellow Sapphire** (Pushparaga) | Coin/Electric | CONFIRMED — Jupiter governs prosperity and dharmic wealth |
| Shukra (Venus) | **Diamond** (Vajra) | Order | CONTESTED — Venus governs love, beauty, and creativity. Diamond's placement in Order privileges its structural perfection over its Venusian sensuality |
| Shani (Saturn) | **Blue Sapphire** (Indranila) | Order | CONFIRMED — Saturn governs structure, discipline, karma. Blue Sapphire in Order aligns perfectly with Shani's nature |
| Rahu (North Node) | **Hessonite Garnet** (Gomeda) | *Not distinguished* | NOTED — v1.0 lists "Garnet (Almandine)" in Fire; Hessonite is a different variety |
| Ketu (South Node) | **Cat's Eye Chrysoberyl** (Vaidurya) | Coin/Electric | CONTESTED — Ketu governs spiritual liberation and detachment, not commerce |

**Key Concerns:**

1. **Emerald in Earth vs. Mercury/Air.** The Garuda Purana Ch. LXXI assigns
   emerald to Mercury (Budha), a planet of communication, intellect, and
   translation — qualities that align with the Air petal (D8), not Earth (D6).
   However, Emerald's green color and beryllium-aluminum chemistry do resonate
   with earth. The Ratna Shastra acknowledges this tension: the gem's *planet*
   suggests Air, but its *body* suggests Earth.

2. **Diamond in Order vs. Venus.** The Garuda Purana Ch. LXVIII, v.17 states
   "Pure, flawless gems have auspicious powers." Diamond is Venus's gem —
   associated with love, luxury, and aesthetic perfection. Placing it in Order
   captures its crystallographic perfection but misses its Venusian nature.
   The Council notes this is an acceptable trade-off for an RPG system where
   structural integrity is more gameplayrelevant than romantic symbolism.

3. **Absence of Coral.** The Navaratna system requires coral (Vidruma) for
   Mars. A future expansion could add 8 more species (72 total) to include
   coral, bringing the system into fuller Navaratna alignment.

4. **Chrysoberyl's placement in Coin.** Cat's Eye Chrysoberyl (Vaidurya) is
   Ketu's gem — the south lunar node associated with spiritual detachment,
   not material exchange. However, v1.0 places regular golden chrysoberyl
   (not cat's eye specifically) in Coin, which is acceptable if the cat's
   eye variety is acknowledged as carrying different energy.

**Verdict:** The v1.0 arrangement is *largely compatible* with the Navaratna
system. The Emerald-Earth placement is the most significant departure but is
defensible on chromatic and geological grounds.

  - Ch. 33: Turquoise (*callaina*)
  - Ch. 39: Lapis Lazuli (*sapphiros*)
  - Book 36, Ch. 67: Obsidian

### Critique

Theophrastus established the first systematic mineralogy in *On Stones*,
Sections 1-3. His foundational claim:

> "Of the substances formed in the ground, some are made of **water** and some
> of **earth**. The metals obtained by mining come from water; from earth come
> stones, including the more precious kinds." — Section 1

This **binary elemental system** (earth vs. water) presents a challenge to
our 8-element model. Under Theophrastus, ALL gemstones are "earthen" — they
are distinguished not by element but by properties: hardness, color, power
of attraction, ability to be burnt.

**Specific Placements the Naturalists Would Challenge:**

1. **Amber in Coin/Electric.** Theophrastus discusses amber (*elektron*) in
   Sections 37-47, noting its power of attraction — the same property he
   attributes to *lyngourion* (Section 5). He observes amber draws "straws
   and bits of wood" but does not assign it an element. However, the Greek
   word *ēlektron* literally gave us "electricity." Pliny (Book 37, Ch. 11:
   "Amber: the many falsehoods that have been told about it") devotes an
   entire chapter to debunking amber myths while acknowledging its genuine
   attractive power. The Coin/Electric placement is *anachronistic but
   etymologically perfect* — the Naturalists would accept it as a modernization.

2. **Opal in Chaos.** Pliny (Book 37, Ch. 21-22) calls the opal the most
   remarkable of gems, containing "the fire of the carbuncle, the brilliant
   purple of the amethyst, the sea-green of the emerald, all shining
   together in incredible union." This description — many elements combined
   in one stone — resonates powerfully with Chaos (D10, Tricksters &
   Remixers). The Naturalists confirm this placement.

3. **Turquoise in Water.** Pliny (Book 37, Ch. 33) describes *callaina* as
   a green stone, not blue — the ancients knew a greener variety. Placing it
   in Water privileges the modern blue turquoise. The Naturalists would note
   that ancient turquoise was greener and might belong in Earth. However,
   the stone's hydrated copper aluminum phosphate chemistry (it literally
   requires water to maintain color) supports the Water placement.

4. **Obsidian in Order.** Pliny (Book 36, Ch. 67, not Book 37) describes
   obsidian as a volcanic glass named after its discoverer Obsius. As an
   *amorphous* substance (no crystal structure), obsidian is literally the
   antithesis of crystallographic order. Theophrastus (Section 3) would
   classify it as a substance "solidified through heat" — placing it closer
   to Fire. The v1.0 placement in Order privileges obsidian's use as a
   *truth mirror* and surgical precision tool over its geological nature.

**IMPORTANT NOTE on Sapphire/Lapis:** In Pliny's time, "sapphirus" (Book 37,
Ch. 39) referred to **lapis lazuli** — a blue stone "with spots of gold"
(pyrite inclusions). Modern sapphire (corundum) was known as "hyacinthus."
The v1.0 correctly separates Lapis Lazuli (Water) from Sapphire (Order),
but should acknowledge this historical name-swap in player-facing lore.

**Verdict:** The Naturalists approve 6 of 8 elemental petals. They contest
Obsidian-in-Order (should be Fire by formation) and note the ancient
green-turquoise question. The amber-electricity connection, while
anachronistic to their era, would delight them.

### Critique

Hildegard's *Physica* Book IV treats 26 stones through the **four-humour /
four-element** framework: hot/cold, wet/dry. Each stone's medicinal power
derives from its elemental birth-moment:

- **Emerald** (smaragdus): "formed at sunrise" by the green of nature.
  Effective against "all human weaknesses and infirmities." Born of
  *earth-and-water-at-dawn*.
- **Hyacinth** (jacinth/zircon): "has its origins in fire at the first hour
  of the day when the air is moderately warm." Born of *fire-tempered-by-air*.
- **Sapphire**: "formed at midday" — full solar fire.

Hildegard's unique theological claim: **the devil flees from gemstones**
because they remind him of the beauty of heaven before his fall. Gems are
spiritually pure in a way that other earthly substances are not.

**Where the Abbess Would Intervene:**

1. **Amethyst belongs to temperance, not just ether.** Hildegard treats
   amethyst among her 26 stones for its cooling, sobering properties. In the
   medieval humoral system, it is cold-and-dry — associated with Earth, not
   Ether. However, its crown-chakra association in later traditions and its
   violet color (the color of spirit) make the Ether placement defensible
   for a modern system. The Abbess consents with reservation.

2. **Jasper is underrepresented.** Marbode's *De Lapidibus* begins its
   treatment of the Twelve Foundation Stones (Revelation 21:19-20) with
   jasper — the first stone of the New Jerusalem. Hildegard also treats
   jasper prominently. The v1.0 places only "Red Jasper" in Fire, but the
   jasper family (green jasper, ocean jasper, picture jasper) spans multiple
   elements. Jasper is a *universal* stone in the medieval tradition, present
   in all four elements.

3. **The watery nature of gems.** Albertus Magnus (*De Mineralibus*, Book II)
   states that "gems differ from other stones in that the **watery element
   preponderates** over the earthy constituent." This suggests that ALL gems
   carry a fundamentally watery essence — they are crystallized light-in-water.
   The v1.0 treats Water as just one of eight elements, but the medieval
   tradition sees water as the *medium* through which all gems form.

4. **Healing properties as game mechanics.** Hildegard prescribes specific
   stones for specific ailments: sardonyx for fever, emerald for eye-strain,
   onyx for convalescence. In the Dice Godz context, each gemstone species
   should carry a **healing resonance** — a condition it soothes or a wound
   it mends. This is not just flavor; it's the stone's *purpose for existing*.

**Verdict:** The Abbess finds the 8-element system admirable as a expansion
of the four classical elements but insists that Water's role as *universal
medium* be acknowledged, that Jasper's range be honored, and that every
species carry healing purpose.

### Critique

Science offers three orthogonal classification systems that can validate or
challenge the elemental placements:

#### A. Crystal System Distribution

The 7 crystal systems map unevenly across the 8 petals:

| Petal | Trigonal | Hexagonal | Cubic | Monoclinic | Orthorhombic | Tetragonal | Amorphous |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fire | Ruby(T), Garnet(C), Carnelian(T), Sunstone(Tr), R.Jasper(T), Spinel(C) | — | Garnet, Spinel, Pyrite(C) | — | — | — | F.Opal(A) |
| Earth | — | Emerald(H), Jade: mono | — | Jade(M), Serpentine(M), Unakite(M) | Peridot(O) | — | M.Agate(T) |
| Water | Aquamarine(H) | — | — | Moonstone(M), Chrysocolla(M,O) | — | — | Pearl(A) |
| Air | Quartz(T) | — | Fluorite(C) | Selenite(M), Kyanite(Tr) | — | Apophyllite(Te) | — |
| Coin | Quartz var.(T) | Heliodor(H) | Chrysoberyl(O) | — | — | — | Amber(A) |
| Chaos | — | — | Alexandrite(O), Bismuth(T) | — | — | — | Opal(A) |
| Ether | Quartz var.(T) | Sugilite(H) | — | Charoite(M), Lepidolite(M), Kunzite(M) | Tanzanite(O) | — | — |
| Order | — | — | Diamond(C) | Azurite(M) | — | — | Obsidian(A), Shungite(A) |

**Key observation:** The cubic system (highest symmetry, most "ordered")
appears in Fire (Garnet, Spinel, Pyrite), Air (Fluorite), and Order (Diamond) —
but NOT exclusively in Order. Amorphous minerals (no crystal structure) appear
in Fire (Fire Opal), Water (Pearl), Coin (Amber), Chaos (Opal), and Order
(Obsidian, Shungite). Having two amorphous minerals in Order is the most
problematic scientific placement.

#### B. Mohs Hardness as Game Stat

Complete hardness map for the 64 species:

| Petal | Species & Hardness |
|---|---|
| **Fire** | Ruby 9, Garnet 6.5-7.5, Carnelian 6.5-7, Fire Opal 5.5-6.5, Sunstone 6-6.5, Red Jasper 6.5-7, Pyrite 6-6.5, Spinel 7.5-8 |
| **Earth** | Emerald 7.5-8, Jade 6-6.5, Malachite 3.5-4, Peridot 6.5-7, Moss Agate 6.5-7, Green Aventurine 6.5-7, Serpentine 3-6, Unakite 6-7 |
| **Air** | Clear Quartz 7, Fluorite 4, Celestite 3-3.5, Blue Topaz 8, Sodalite 5.5-6, Kyanite 4.5-7*, Selenite 2, Apophyllite 4.5-5 |
| **Water** | Aquamarine 7.5-8, Lapis Lazuli 5-6, Larimar 4.5-5, Pearl 2.5-4.5, Moonstone 6-6.5, Chrysocolla 2-4, Blue Lace Agate 6.5-7, Turquoise 5-6 |
| **Coin** | Citrine 7, Tiger's Eye 6.5-7, Amber 2-2.5, Yellow Topaz 8, Rutilated Quartz 7, Heliodor 7.5-8, Yellow Sapphire 9, Chrysoberyl 8.5 |
| **Chaos** | Opal 5.5-6.5, Labradorite 6-6.5, Alexandrite 8.5, Bismuth 2-2.5, Ametrine 7, Bornite 3, W. Tourmaline 7-7.5, Sphalerite 3.5-4 |
| **Ether** | Amethyst 7, Sugilite 5.5-6.5, Charoite 5-6, Lepidolite 2.5-3, Tanzanite 6-7, Kunzite 6.5-7, Spirit Quartz 7, Iolite 7-7.5 |
| **Order** | Diamond 10, Sapphire 9, Obsidian 5-5.5, Hematite 5.5-6.5, Onyx 6.5-7, Black Tourmaline 7-7.5, Azurite 3.5-4, Shungite 3.5-4 |

*Kyanite has directional hardness: 4.5 along one axis, 7 along the other.

**Petal Average Hardness (for game balancing):**
- Coin: **7.2** (highest — hardest petal, driven by Sapphire 9 + Chrysoberyl 8.5)
- Fire: **7.1**
- Order: **6.5** (but extreme range: Diamond 10 down to Azurite 3.5)
- Earth: **5.9**
- Ether: **5.9**
- Chaos: **5.4**
- Water: **5.2**
- Air: **5.0** (lowest — softest petal, dragged down by Selenite 2 and Fluorite 4)

**Game design implication:** Hardness could map to a **Defense** or
**Resilience** stat. The current distribution creates natural archetypes:
Coin species are "tanks," Air species are "glass cannons." This is
accidentally elegant.

#### C. Piezoelectric & Pyroelectric Properties

Stones that generate electric charge under mechanical stress (piezoelectric)
or temperature change (pyroelectric):

| Property | Stones in v1.0 | Petal |
|---|---|---|
| Piezoelectric | Clear Quartz, Citrine, Amethyst, Rutilated Quartz, Ametrine, Spirit Quartz | Air, Coin, Ether, Chaos |
| Pyroelectric | Tourmaline (all varieties), Blue Topaz, Yellow Topaz | Air, Coin, Chaos, Order |
| Both | All tourmalines, all quartz varieties | Multiple petals |

**Concern:** The v1.0 places the most electrically active mineral (Quartz)
in Air, not Coin/Electric. This is scientifically defensible (quartz's
transparency and universality align with Air's "translation" theme) but means
the Coin/Electric petal isn't the most electrically active petal by
piezoelectric count. Citrine, Rutilated Quartz, and Amber (the etymological
source of "electricity") do anchor the electrical theme adequately.

#### D. Formation Environment vs. Elemental Placement

| Formation | Expected Petal | Stones Currently Elsewhere |
|---|---|---|
| Igneous/Volcanic | Fire | Obsidian (→Order), Peridot (→Earth), Labradorite (→Chaos), Larimar (→Water) |
| Metamorphic | Earth or Ether | Jade (Earth✓), Tanzanite (Ether✓), Kyanite (Air✓) |
| Sedimentary | Water or Earth | Pearl (Water✓), Amber (Coin), Turquoise (Water✓) |
| Hydrothermal | Water | Emerald (→Earth), Amethyst (→Ether), Fluorite (→Air) |

**Observation:** Many gems placed outside Fire actually form in
igneous/volcanic environments. This is acceptable because the system
prioritizes *cultural resonance* and *gameplay function* over geological
origin. The Crystallographer notes the discrepancies but does not insist
on reclassification.

**Verdict:** The Crystallographer finds the system surprisingly well-balanced.
The hardness distribution creates natural gameplay archetypes. The main
scientific objection is two amorphous substances (Obsidian, Shungite) in the
Order petal — the petal of structure should contain the most structured
minerals, not the least. Consider swapping Obsidian to Fire (its formation
environment) and replacing it with Galena (perfect cubic crystals, PbS).

### Critique

The Pacific does not separate stone from story. Pounamu (New Zealand jade /
nephrite) is classified by Māori not by chemistry but by *appearance-as-kin*:

| Māori Name | Meaning | Color | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Kawakawa** | Named for kawakawa tree leaves | Deep green with dark flecks | Most common, everyday tools and jewelry |
| **Kahurangi** | "Person of high rank" | Vivid light green, no flaws | Rarest; ceremonial adzes (*toki poutangata*) for chiefs |
| **Īnanga** | Named for whitebait fish | Pearly-white, grey-green | Most prized for ornaments and *mere* (clubs) |
| **Tangiwai** | "Tears of great sorrow" | Translucent, like a water drop | Named for a lamenting woman's tears turned to stone |
| **Kōkopu** | Named for spotted freshwater fish | Olive green, dark spots | Resembles fish markings |
| **Totoweka** | "Weka blood" | Green with red streaks | Rare, named for flightless bird |

**The Carver's Observations:**

1. **Jade is undervalued in v1.0.** In Māori tradition, pounamu is taonga
   (treasure) — it carries *whakapapa* (genealogy). A single piece of jade
   may be named, carry the *mana* (spiritual power) of its previous owners,
   and be passed down for generations. The v1.0 places jade as one of eight
   Earth species. In a Pacific context, jade IS the earth — it doesn't just
   *represent* earth, it *is* the substance through which earth expresses
   its highest purpose.

2. **Pearl's placement in Water is confirmed — but Pearl is alive.** In
   Pacific culture, pearl is not "just a gem." The Kumulipo creation chant
   describes the first epoch beginning in darkness: "Born was the coral
   polyp, born was the coral, came forth." Pearl, coral, and shell are
   *living architecture*. The Carver affirms Pearl in Water but insists its
   species description acknowledge it as the only gem made by a living being.

3. **Stone and agriculture are inseparable.** The Māori kumara (sweet potato)
   gardens used **stone thermal engineering**: small stones were added to
   raised mounds and stone walls were built around gardens. The stones
   absorbed solar heat during the day and radiated it at night, extending
   the growing season by **up to one month**. Waikato Māori moved an
   estimated **four million cubic metres** of sand and gravel for their
   gardens (Furey, SAP 235). Stone is not decoration — it is agricultural
   technology.

4. **Hawaiian lo'i kalo** (taro pondfields) used stone-walled terraces
   (*kuauna*) with gravity-fed stone-lined irrigation channels (*'auwai*).
   An acre of lo'i produced **five times** the yield of dryland cultivation.
   The relationship between stone, water, and food is the foundation of
   Pacific civilization.

**The Carver's Requirement:** Any gemstone species system that claims to
include jade must honor the principle that **stone carries genealogy**.
Each gemstone species should be able to carry a *name*, a *lineage*, and
a *story of who held it before*. This is not optional flavor text — it is
the stone's identity.

**Verdict:** The placements are acceptable as a starting framework, but the
system must build in mechanisms for stones to carry history. The Māori
classification by *appearance-as-kin* (naming stones after trees, fish, birds)
is a model for how players might name their own gemstone companions.

### Critique

**Turquoise is not a water stone. Turquoise is a sky-and-south stone.**

Mattson (2022) demonstrates that at Chaco Canyon (10th-12th century CE),
minerals and colored materials were placed in kiva pilaster repositories
according to **directional color schemes**. Turquoise was associated with
specific cardinal directions and cosmographic elements. In many Pueblo
traditions, turquoise is associated with the **south** direction and with
**sky** — not water.

The Diné (Navajo) associate turquoise (*dootl'izh*) with the **south**
direction, one of the Four Sacred Mountains, and with the daytime sky.
Turquoise is paired with sky, not sea. The Nahuatl word for turquoise,
*xihuitl*, is also the word for "year" and "comet" — connecting it to time
and celestial fire, not water.

**The Keeper's Specific Challenges:**

1. **Turquoise should be in Air, not Water.** Sky stone. South stone.
   Breath stone. The hydrated copper aluminum phosphate chemistry (needing
   water to maintain color) is true, but the cultural identity of turquoise
   across Pueblo, Diné, Apache, and Mexica traditions is overwhelmingly
   sky/air/south. The v1.0 Water placement privileges Western mineral
   chemistry over Indigenous knowledge.

   **Counter-argument:** Turquoise does span water AND air — it is the stone
   where sky meets water. Its placement in either petal is defensible. The
   Council recommends noting this sky-water duality in the species
   description. If the system is to be modular (allowing player adaptation),
   turquoise should be explicitly marked as a **boundary species** that
   players of Pueblo or Diné heritage may rightfully place in Air.

2. **Obsidian is sacred to Tezcatlipoca.** The Smoking Mirror of Aztec/Mexica
   tradition is not merely "truth-telling" — it is the Lord of Night, the
   Jaguar, the force that tests and transforms. Obsidian belongs to **Chaos**
   or **Ether** in the TEK8 system, not Order. The Florentine Codex (Book 11)
   describes obsidian's ritual uses extensively. Its surgical sharpness is
   a Fire property; its divinatory mirror is an Ether property; its
   association with Tezcatlipoca's unpredictable testing is a Chaos property.

3. **The absence of pipestone (Catlinite).** The Sacred Red Pipestone from
   Pipestone, Minnesota (Catlinite) is one of the most culturally significant
   minerals in Indigenous North America. Its absence from the 64 is noted.
   Like coral in the Navaratna system, it belongs to a future expansion.

4. **Directional mineral placement.** Mattson (2022) shows that Indigenous
   mineral placement is **directional and cosmographic**, not just elemental.
   The 40 Rainbow Roads (8 petals × 5 positions: OUT, UP, DWN, U45, D45)
   already encode directionality. The gemstone species system should allow
   stones to be placed at specific *positions within petals*, not just in
   petals generically. Turquoise at D8-OUT (Air, outer ring) is different
   from turquoise at D8-UP (Air, ascending).

**Verdict:** Turquoise and Obsidian are the two most contested placements
from an Indigenous Americas perspective. The system should mark both as
**boundary species** with documented alternative placements. The modular
framework MUST allow Indigenous players to reposition these stones according
to their own traditions.

### Critique

**Preparation BD 501 — Horn Silica — is the bridge between gemstones and
agriculture.**

Steiner's biodynamic system uses **ground quartz crystals** (Preparation 501)
packed in a cow horn, buried over summer, then diluted and sprayed as fine mist.
Research at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University and the Josephine Porter
Institute documents its effects: enhanced photosynthesis, stronger plant
immunity, improved flavor and storage quality. Silicon builds up at sites
of plant injury, stimulating natural defense compounds.

**The Steward's Framework: Plants & Elements**

Maria Thun's research (from the 1940s onward, Darmstadt) established the
biodynamic element-plant mapping:

| Element | Plant Part | Zodiac Signs | Crops |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Earth** | Root | Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn | Carrots, beets, potatoes |
| **Water** | Leaf | Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces | Lettuce, spinach, cabbage |
| **Air/Light** | Flower | Gemini, Libra, Aquarius | Ornamentals, broccoli, herbs |
| **Fire/Warmth** | Fruit/Seed | Aries, Leo, Sagittarius | Tomatoes, peppers, grains |

**Extending to 8 elements for the Dice Godz garden:**

| TEK8 Petal | Plant Domain | Gardening Focus | Mineral Soil Link |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fire (D4) | Fruit/Seed | South-facing, heat-loving | Pyrite → sulfur for soil |
| Earth (D6) | Root | Compost-rich, deep beds | Malachite → copper micronutrient |
| Water (D20) | Leaf | Rain gardens, water features | Selenite/gypsum → soil amendment |
| Air (D8) | Flower | Aromatic herbs, wind corridors | Quartz → BD 501 preparation |
| Coin (D2) | Pollinator | Bee/butterfly attractors | Tiger's Eye → solar charging |
| Chaos (D10) | Wildflower | Seed bombs, experimental | Bismuth → trace element diversity |
| Ether (D12) | Night-blooming | Meditation garden, incense | Amethyst → crown vibration |
| Order (D100) | Heritage | Formal geometry, seed saving | Hematite → iron for chlorophyll |

**Mineral-to-Soil Amendment Correspondences:**

Several gemstones in the v1.0 list have direct agricultural applications:

| Gemstone | Chemical | Agricultural Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Selenite** (Air) | CaSO₄·2H₂O | Identical to gypsum — major soil amendment |
| **Pyrite** (Fire) | FeS₂ | Sulfur and iron source |
| **Malachite** (Earth) | Cu₂CO₃(OH)₂ | Copper micronutrient |
| **Azurite** (Order) | Cu₃(CO₃)₂(OH)₂ | Copper micronutrient |
| **Hematite** (Order) | Fe₂O₃ | Iron for chlorophyll production |
| **Fluorite** (Air) | CaF₂ | Calcium source |
| **Tourmaline** (Chaos) | Complex borosilicate | Boron — critical micronutrient |
| **Sphalerite** (Chaos) | ZnS | Zinc — essential for plant growth hormones |

**The Steward's strongest critique:** Selenite (gypsum) is in the Air petal,
but its agricultural function is overwhelmingly an **Earth** amendment (clay
soil improvement, calcium delivery). Similarly, Hematite is in Order but its
iron content serves **Earth** functions (chlorophyll production). The garden
system reveals misalignments that pure mineral aesthetics might miss.

**The Mandala Garden Connection:**

An 8-petal mandala garden (as described by Woodrow and permaculture
practitioners) maps perfectly to the TEK8 structure:
- **Center hub**: Water feature, compost, or sacred stone
- **8 radiating beds**: 1.2-1.5m wide, each dedicated to one elemental petal
- **8 keyhole paths**: 0.6m wide, between beds
- **Outer ring**: Perennial herbs, fruit trees, living fence
- **Typical diameter**: 8-14 meters

Each bed contains plants aligned with its element AND a buried crystal grid
of the corresponding gemstone species. The Māori kumara stone-thermal
principle (Furey, SAP 235) provides scientific backing: stones absorb and
radiate heat, genuinely extending growing seasons.

The Medicine Wheel Garden tradition (documented by
[UMN Extension](https://extension.umn.edu/news/four-directions-medicine-garden-healing-through-cultural-connection))
uses 4 cardinal directions mapped to elements, seasons, and colors. Our
8-petal system doubles this by adding intercardinal directions.

**Verdict:** The Earth Steward enthusiastically endorses the system. The
8-petal mandala garden is a proven permaculture form. The mineral-to-soil
connections are real and scientifically grounded. Minor adjustments: consider
Selenite's dual Air/Earth nature, and ensure the gardening component
acknowledges both Māori stone-thermal engineering and Steiner's BD 501 quartz
preparation as precedents.

## THE COUNCIL DELIBERATION

### Contested Placements Requiring Resolution

After hearing all seven perspectives, the Council identifies these stones as
requiring explicit documentation of their **boundary nature**:

| Stone | v1.0 Petal | Alternative Petal(s) | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Turquoise** | Water | Air (Indigenous), Earth (Pliny) | Sky-stone in Pueblo/Diné; green in antiquity |
| **Obsidian** | Order | Fire (formation), Chaos (Tezcatlipoca), Ether (divination) | Amorphous = anti-Order; volcanic = Fire |
| **Emerald** | Earth | Air (Jyotish/Mercury) | Mercury's gem = communication/Air |
| **Diamond** | Order | Coin (Venus/beauty), Ether (Vajra/thunderbolt) | Venus's gem; Vajra = spiritual weapon |
| **Selenite** | Air | Earth (agricultural gypsum), Water (named for Moon/tides) | Major soil amendment; lunar name |
| **Amethyst** | Ether | Earth (Hildegard: cold/dry) | Medieval: cooling/sobering = Earth quality |
| **Chrysoberyl** | Coin | Ether (Ketu = spiritual liberation) | Navaratna Ketu gem = detachment, not commerce |

### The Council's Recommendations

**The Council does NOT recommend wholesale reclassification.** The v1.0
arrangement is a strong intuitive foundation that aligns with more traditions
than it contradicts. Instead, the Council recommends:

1. **Mark boundary species.** The 7 contested stones above should be tagged
   as "boundary species" in the system, with documented alternative placements
   for different cultural traditions.

2. **Swap Obsidian from Order to Fire.** This is the single strongest
   critique across multiple traditions (amorphous structure contradicts Order;
   volcanic formation is Fire; Tezcatlipoca's mirror is Chaos/Ether). Replace
   with **Galena** (PbS, perfect cubic crystals — literally geometric order)
   or **Magnetite** (Fe₃O₄, natural lodestone — creates magnetic order).

3. **Add healing resonances.** Per the Abbess: every species should carry a
   condition it soothes. This is mechanically useful for the RPG system
   (healing items) and philosophically grounded in Hildegard, Ayurveda, and
   Indigenous medicine.

4. **Enable stone genealogy.** Per the Pounamu Carver: each gemstone species
   should be nameable and carry lineage/history data. In the RPG system, this
   means stones can be traded, inherited, and storied.

5. **Build in garden mapping.** Per the Earth Steward: each species should
   have a garden-zone correspondence — which petal-bed it goes in, what
   companion plants it supports, what soil function its mineral chemistry
   serves.

6. **Acknowledge Water as universal medium.** Per the Abbess (via Albertus
   Magnus): water is the medium through which all gems form. The Water petal
   (D20, Storykeepers & Healers) has a special role — it is not just one
   element among eight but the element through which memory and healing flow.

7. **Note the Navaratna gaps.** Red Coral and Pipestone/Catlinite are the
   most significant absences. A future "expansion pack" of 8 additional
   species (reaching 72) could address these.

## THE REFINED v1.1 ARRANGEMENT

Based on the Council's deliberation, the following change is recommended
for the initial framework:

### Single Change: Obsidian → Fire; Magnetite → Order

| # | ORDER v1.0 | ORDER v1.1 (Proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| 57 | Diamond | Diamond |
| 58 | Sapphire | Sapphire |
| 59 | **Obsidian** | **Magnetite** (Fe₃O₄) — natural lodestone, creates magnetic order |
| 60 | Hematite | Hematite |
| 61 | Onyx | Onyx |
| 62 | Black Tourmaline | Black Tourmaline |
| 63 | Azurite | Azurite |
| 64 | Shungite | Shungite |

| # | FIRE v1.0 | FIRE v1.1 (Proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ruby | Ruby |
| 2 | Garnet | Garnet |
| 3 | Carnelian | Carnelian |
| 4 | Fire Opal | Fire Opal |
| 5 | Sunstone | Sunstone |
| 6 | Red Jasper | Red Jasper |
| 7 | Pyrite | Pyrite |
| 8 | Spinel | **Obsidian** (volcanic glass, Tezcatlipoca's mirror, born of fire) |

**Rationale:** Spinel moves out of Fire. But wait — this disrupts Fire's
cohesion. Alternative: keep Fire as-is with 8 members and swap within Order.

**FINAL COUNCIL DECISION:** Rather than disrupting two petals, the Council
recommends **the v1.0 arrangement stands as the initial framework** with
Obsidian remaining in Order and all 7 contested stones marked as
**boundary species** with documented alternatives. The modular framework
(next document) will provide the mechanism for players and communities to
adjust placements according to their own traditions.

**This preserves the initial 64 while honoring every tradition's objections
through the boundary-species mechanism.**
