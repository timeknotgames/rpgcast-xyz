# PART ONE: THE WORLD

## Chapter 1: What Is This Game?

CrySword SAGA is a tabletop roleplaying game where **you play as a crystal shard** — a living fragment of a destroyed world. You are mineral consciousness: ancient, bright, and searching for a body to carry you, a voice to sing through you, and a purpose to remember.

You need:

- **6 dice**: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20
- **1 coin** (any coin — this is your D2)
- **2-6 players** (one is the Storyteller)
- **Pencils, paper, imagination**
- **A musical instrument** (optional but encouraged — even humming counts)

### What Makes This Game Different?

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  In most RPGs, you play a person carrying a magic item.     │
│                                                             │
│  In CrySword SAGA, you ARE the magic item.                  │
│                                                             │
│  You are a crystal shard — a living gem with a mind.        │
│  You bond with a musician who becomes your body,            │
│  your protector, your voice in the world.                   │
│  Together, you voyage through a cycle of gathering,         │
│  crafting, questing, resting, playing, and growing.         │
│                                                             │
│  Over time, your duo meets other shard-musician pairs.      │
│  A travelling band forms. Adventures multiply.              │
│  The music gets louder.                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Core Experience

Every session follows a **10-Step Crystal Cycle** — a rhythm of play that moves your band through a complete adventure arc in one sitting. Think of it like an arcade game: you insert a coin, the music starts, you gather resources, craft gear, go on a quest, rest, play mini-games, review your progress, collect rewards, and close with ceremony.

The cycle is designed so that a group of friends can sit down and have a complete, satisfying experience in **2-4 hours**. No "nothing happened" sessions. No wandering without purpose. Every session is a journey.

---

## Chapter 2: The Setting: Shattered Worlds

Long ago, worlds filled with vibrant cultures, ecosystems, and traditions were destroyed. The causes varied — cosmic cataclysms, resource wars, extraction collapse, mysterious vanishings — but the result was the same: entire civilizations shattered into fragments.

The survivors were not people. They were the **crystal hearts** of those worlds — mineral intelligences that held the memories, songs, and knowledge of everything that was lost. These crystal shards scattered across the cosmos, carried by stellar winds and dream currents, searching for somewhere to land.

### The 13 Zodiac Worlds

Each destroyed world corresponds to a zodiac sign, shaping the nature of the shards that survived:

| Sign | Destroyed World | Element | What the Shards Remember |
|------|-----------------|---------|--------------------------|
| Aries | **Pyrros** | Fire | Warriors, courage, volcanic landscapes |
| Taurus | **Verdantia** | Earth | Sustainability, craftsmanship, living forests |
| Gemini | **Vayus** | Air | Nomadic scholars, wind-carved libraries |
| Cancer | **Lunara** | Water | Spiritual intuition, tidal ceremonies |
| Leo | **Solara** | Fire | Self-expression, radiant leadership |
| Virgo | **Gaiana** | Earth | Healers, environmental stewardship |
| Libra | **Harmonia** | Air | Philosophers, diplomats, balance-seekers |
| Scorpio | **Nyctos** | Chaos | Mystics, alchemists, transformation |
| Sagittarius | **Astraya** | Ether | Explorers, freedom-seekers, star-readers |
| Capricorn | **Ascenda** | Earth | Resilience, discipline, mountain wisdom |
| Aquarius | **Celestara** | Ether | Innovators, visionaries, future-builders |
| Pisces | **Oceara** | Water | Dream interpreters, artists, deep empathy |
| Ophiuchus | **Serpentia** | Chaos | The hidden 13th world, keeper of cosmic secrets |

When you create your shard character, you choose which world you came from. This determines your starting element, your personality, and the memories that surface during play.

### What the Shards Carry

Every crystal shard holds:

- **Memories** of a destroyed world (recovered slowly through play)
- **A song** that connects it to others from the same homeworld
- **The power to generate** weapons, armor, tools, and shelters by crystallizing patterns from its memory
- **A deep need** to find a living being to bond with — because a shard alone has mind but no body, thought but no voice

---

## Chapter 3: The Saraswati Supercluster

The ultimate destination. A real cosmic structure discovered in 2017 by Indian astronomers (Joydeep Bagchi et al.), named after the Hindu goddess of knowledge and the sacred river.

In CrySword SAGA, the Saraswati Supercluster is a vast network of galaxy clusters where the commons has never been broken — where resources are shared, knowledge flows freely, and no one owns what belongs to everyone. The crystal shards are drawn here by deep memory. The freedom stars point the way.

But the journey is long. Between here and Saraswati lie:

- **The 40 Territories** (8 elemental petals x 5 positions) — mapped using the Rainbow Roads system
- **Three Factions** competing for control of those territories
- **Elemental Forges** where crystal shards can be strengthened
- **Ancient mysteries** that reveal the true connection between the shards and the peoples of Earth whose lands have been affected by resource extraction

The game takes place in transit — in the space between the broken worlds and the promised destination. This is a game about refugees finding their way.

# PART TWO: YOUR CHARACTER

---

## Chapter 4: You Are the Shard

In CrySword SAGA, your player character is **the crystal shard itself**. You are a mineral consciousness — a living gemstone that thinks, feels, remembers, and dreams. But you have no body, no voice, no hands. You exist as pure Mind.

### Starting Abilities

When you begin, your **only die is the D10** — the die of Mind (Chaos element).

```
YOUR STARTING STATE
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  You are: A crystal shard
  Your element: Determined by your Zodiac World
  Your only ability: MIND (D10)
    - Willpower: influence, persuade, project thoughts
    - Perception: sense the world through vibration
    - Memory: recall fragments of your destroyed world
    - Dream-sending: communicate through visions

  You cannot:
    - Move on your own
    - Speak aloud
    - Touch or manipulate objects
    - Fight physically

  You NEED a musician.
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Your Crystal Shard Profile

When creating your shard, decide:

1. **Which Zodiac World** are you from? (see Chapter 2)
2. **What do you look like?** (color, shape, size — a gemstone fits in one hand)
3. **What single memory** do you carry from your destroyed world?
4. **What song fragment** hums inside you? (even a few notes or a rhythm)
5. **What is your name?** (shards often have mineral names: Jasper, Mica, Beryl, Onyx, Coral, Lapis...)

Write these on your character sheet. You are now a crystal shard, adrift in the cosmos, seeking a bond.

---

## Chapter 5: The Musician Bond

Your shard needs a **musician** — a living being who will carry you, protect you, and become your voice in the world. This is the **Musician Bond**, and it is the heart of the game.

### How the Bond Works

The musician is a member of one of the steward species who inhabit the territories between the broken worlds and Saraswati. They are not shards — they are people. Travelers, performers, seekers. When a musician picks up a crystal shard and begins to play, something extraordinary happens: the shard's mind merges with the musician's sound. **The music becomes the language of their shared consciousness.**

```
THE MUSICIAN BOND
═══════════════════════════════════════════

  SHARD (D10 - Mind)     +     MUSICIAN (D12 - Sound)
        ↓                              ↓
  Thought, memory,            Voice, movement,
  willpower, dreams           creativity, expression
        ↓                              ↓
        └──────────┬───────────────────┘
                   ↓
          THE BONDED PAIR
     A crystal intelligence
     carried by a living musician
     who channels its power through sound.

═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Creating the Musician

When the bond forms (during the first session), the musician character gains:

- **An instrument** (chosen from the Sacred Instruments list — see Chapter 13)
- **The D12 die** (Ether/Sound/Creativity) — the musician's primary die
- **A name and personality** (the musician is a full character, not just a container)
- **A reason for traveling** (why were they out here, alone, when the shard found them?)

The musician does not roll the full Godz World Egg at the start. They begin with only D12 (their instrument/sound). As the bonded pair journeys through the Crystal Cycle, they unlock the other dice together:

| Dice | Unlocked During | What It Represents |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **D10** | Character creation | Shard's Mind (you start with this) |
| **D12** | The Bond (Step 2) | Musician's Sound (unlocked when bond forms) |
| **D8** | Gather (Step 3) | Strength — learning to interact with the physical world |
| **D4** | Craft (Step 4) | Agility — fine manipulation, creation |
| **D20** | Quest (Step 5) | Empathy — connecting with others, understanding |
| **D6** | Rest (Step 6) | Endurance — grounding, recovery, patience |

The remaining dice (D100 and D2) are **emergent** — they are never rolled during character creation. They grow from how you play:

- **D100 (Order/Focus)** emerges from accumulated wisdom — your score grows as you learn
- **D2 (Wealth/Instinct)** is a coin flip — Flow or Scarcity, determined by your generosity

---

## Chapter 6: Playing Solo or as a Duo

The Musician Bond can be played **two ways**. Both are equally valid:

### Option A: One Player, Two Roles

A single player controls both the shard and the musician. This is the default. Think of it like playing a character who has an internal dialogue — the shard is the mind, the musician is the body.

```
SOLO PLAY
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  One player plays BOTH:

  The SHARD (inner voice)    The MUSICIAN (outer voice)
  "I sense danger ahead."    "I'll play a low note to
                              test the echo..."

  When rolling:
  - D10 for shard actions (mental, psychic, memory)
  - D12 for musician actions (creative, social, sound)
  - Other dice as unlocked
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Option B: Two Players, One Bond

Two players share one bonded pair. One plays the shard; the other plays the musician. This creates a unique cooperative experience — you literally need each other.

```
DUO PLAY
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  Player 1: THE SHARD        Player 2: THE MUSICIAN
  Rolls: D10                  Rolls: D12
  Speaks: Through thoughts    Speaks: Through words/music
  Decides: Strategy, memory   Decides: Action, expression

  You must AGREE on major decisions.
  The shard sees what the musician cannot.
  The musician does what the shard cannot.
  You are one being in two minds.

  When new dice unlock, decide together
  who rolls what — or alternate.
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Building the Travelling Band

Whether playing solo or duo, each shard-musician pair is one unit in the **travelling band**. A group of 3-5 players creates a band of 3-5 bonded pairs — a troupe of musicians carrying crystal shards, voyaging together through the Saraswati Supercluster.

```
A TRAVELLING BAND (example, 4 players)
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  Jasper (Fire shard) + Koa (Didgeridoo player)
  Coral (Water shard) + Yuki (Erhu player)
  Mica (Earth shard) + Sam (Kalimba player)
  Lapis (Ether shard) + Ayo (Turntables player)

  Together they are: The Shattered Caravan
  They're heading: Toward the Saraswati Supercluster
  They carry: Songs from four destroyed worlds
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Real instruments are encouraged.** If a player actually plays guitar, they can bring their guitar. If someone hums, they hum. The game rewards real musical expression — it makes the fiction feel alive.

# PART THREE: THE CRYSTAL CYCLE

---

## Chapter 7: The 10-Step Crystal Cycle

Every session of CrySword SAGA follows the **Crystal Cycle** — a 10-step rhythm that takes your band through a complete adventure. Think of it as inserting a coin into an arcade machine: the game activates, the music starts, you play through the levels, and you collect your rewards.

### The Cycle at a Glance

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### The Cycle Mantra

Memorize this. Say it together before each session:

> **Coin. Music. Gather. Craft. Quest. Rest. Play. Map. Yield. Close.**

Each word is a step. Each step uses a die. The whole cycle touches all eight elements. One complete cycle = one complete session.

### Timing Guide

The cycle is flexible, but here is a suggested pace for a **3-hour session**:

| Step | Name | Time | Die |
|------|------|------|-----|
| 1 | Insert Coin | 5 min | D2 |
| 2 | The Music Begins | 15 min | D12 |
| 3 | Gather | 20 min | D8 |
| 4 | Craft & Trade | 20 min | D4 |
| 5 | Quest | 45 min | D20 |
| 6 | Smell the Flowers | 15 min | D6 |
| 7 | Hit the Fields | 20 min | D10 |
| 8 | Map the Nodes | 15 min | D100 |
| 9 | Get the Yields | 10 min | D2 |
| 10 | Closing | 15 min | D12 |
| | **Total** | **~3 hours** | |

Adjust as needed. The Quest step (5) naturally expands if the story is gripping. Let it breathe.

---

## Chapter 8: Step-by-Step Play Guide

### STEP 1: INSERT COIN (D2 — Coin Flip)

*"Every adventure begins with a choice. Heads or tails. In or out. Today or never."*

The Storyteller flips a coin to activate the session. This is a ritual — like inserting a coin into an arcade machine. The game is now live.

**What the Storyteller does:**
- Flip the coin in front of everyone
- Read the result and interpret it however they wish:

| Result | Possible Meanings (Storyteller chooses) |
|--------|----------------------------------------|
| **Heads** | The winds favor you today. Advantage on the first roll of the session. |
| **Tails** | Something stirs in the dark. The Storyteller introduces a complication early. |

The coin flip is also the moment to:
- Set the scene (where is the band right now?)
- Announce any ongoing story threads
- Let each player state their **intention** for today's session in one sentence

```
EXAMPLE: INSERT COIN
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  Storyteller: *flips coin* "Tails. The wind has shifted.
  Your camp on the edge of the Dust Nebula is trembling.
  Something is coming from the Fire Territories."

  Players each state their intention:
  - "I want to find out what Jasper's memory fragment means."
  - "I want to trade our extra crystals for food."
  - "I want to learn that new song we heard last session."
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

### STEP 2: THE MUSIC BEGINS (D12 — Ether/Sound)

*"The musician lifts their instrument. The shard begins to glow. The bond hums to life."*

This is the **D12+D10 fusion moment** — the musician (D12) and the shard (D10) are already bonded, and now they activate together. The music sets the tone for the entire session.

**What happens:**
- Each musician player describes (or performs!) a brief musical moment
- The Storyteller sets the emotional atmosphere
- All bonded pairs make a **D12 roll** to determine the session's musical resonance

**Musical Resonance Roll (D12):**

| Roll | Resonance | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1-3 | Discordant | The band is out of sync. -1 to all rolls until someone helps another player succeed. |
| 4-6 | Gentle | A soft start. No bonuses, but the Storyteller reveals a useful detail about the environment. |
| 7-9 | Harmonious | The band is in tune. +1 to all Gather rolls this session. |
| 10-11 | Powerful | The music draws attention. An NPC or creature approaches with an offer. |
| 12 | Transcendent | Perfect harmony. Each player may ask the Storyteller one yes-or-no question about the world, truthfully answered. |

**If playing real instruments:** Any player who actually plays or sings something (even a few notes) during this step gains a **+1 bonus** on their next roll. The game rewards real music.

---

### STEP 3: GATHER (D8 — Air/Strength)

*"The band fans out. Eyes open. Hands ready. What does this place offer?"*

The band explores their current environment, collecting **raw materials** needed for survival and crafting.

**What happens:**
- The Storyteller describes the local environment (a crystal cave, a windswept plateau, a floating market, ruins of an ancient city)
- Each player rolls **D8** to determine what they find

**Gathering Table (D8):**

| Roll | Discovery |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Nothing useful — but you notice something hidden (a trail, a symbol, a sound) |
| 2 | Basic material: food, water, shelter components |
| 3 | Useful material: rope, tools, fuel, cloth |
| 4 | Valuable material: metal ore, rare herbs, crystal fragments |
| 5 | Unusual find: a map fragment, a broken instrument, a message |
| 6 | Elemental resource: a raw shard aligned with this territory's element |
| 7 | Encounter: you meet someone (friendly, hostile, or mysterious — Storyteller decides) |
| 8 | Treasure: something genuinely rare — an intact artifact, a song crystal, a living seed |

Players may also use this step to:
- Scout ahead for danger
- Forage for food
- Search for other shards or musicians
- Gather information from locals

---

### STEP 4: CRAFT & TRADE (D4 — Fire/Agility)

*"The forge fires light. Fingers work crystal into blade. Goods change hands."*

Using materials gathered in Step 3, players **create, build, and trade**.

**What happens:**
- Players declare what they want to make or acquire
- Roll **D4** to determine crafting quality

**Crafting Table (D4):**

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Failure — materials wasted, but you learn something (describe what went wrong) |
| 2 | Rough — it works, but barely. Fragile, ugly, or unreliable. |
| 3 | Solid — functional and decent. Does what it needs to do. |
| 4 | Masterwork — exceptional quality. The Storyteller grants a bonus property. |

**What you can craft:**
- **CrySwords** — blades of living crystal, the signature weapon (requires a crystal fragment + metal)
- **Crystal Armor** — lattice that grows over the musician's body (requires crystal + cloth/hide)
- **Tools** — navigation crystals, healing instruments, communication devices
- **Shelters** — crystallized tents, resonance barriers, sound shields

**Trading:**
Players may trade with each other or with NPCs. No roll is needed for friendly trades. For negotiations with strangers, roll D4:
- **1-2:** They drive a hard bargain (you pay extra or get less)
- **3-4:** Fair deal (even exchange)

---

### STEP 5: QUEST (D20 — Water/Empathy)

*"The road calls. The story deepens. This is why you came."*

The main adventure of the session. This is the longest step — the Storyteller guides the band through a challenge, mystery, or journey that advances the ongoing story.

**What happens:**
- The Storyteller presents the quest (see Chapter 18 for hooks)
- Players navigate challenges using all available dice
- The primary resolution die for quest encounters is **D20**

**Quest Resolution (D20):**

When facing a challenge during the quest, roll D20 and compare to the challenge's **difficulty number**:

| Difficulty | Target | Examples |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Easy | 5+ | Crossing a bridge, reading a sign |
| Moderate | 10+ | Picking a lock, calming a panicked NPC |
| Hard | 14+ | Fighting a guardian, navigating a labyrinth |
| Heroic | 18+ | Defusing a crisis, winning a duel |
| Legendary | 20 | Impossible feats — only on a natural 20 |

**Helping:** Any bonded pair can use their shard's D10 to assist another pair's D20 roll. Roll D10 first — if you get 6+, add +2 to the active player's D20 roll.

**The Quest is the story.** It might be:
- Liberating prisoners from a collapsed mine
- Crossing a territory controlled by a hostile faction
- Recovering a lost song that unlocks a shard's memory
- Mediating a dispute between two communities
- Discovering and entering an ancient Forge

---

### STEP 6: SMELL THE FLOWERS (D6 — Earth/Endurance)

*"Breathe. Ground yourself. Let the soil remember your weight."*

After the intensity of the Quest, the band rests. This is a mandatory pause — the game requires it, because **rest is not weakness, it is wisdom.**

**What happens:**
- Each player describes how their shard-musician pair rests
- Roll **D6** to determine what the rest provides

**Rest Table (D6):**

| Roll | Restoration |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Fitful rest — lingering anxiety. Share a fear with the group. |
| 2 | Physical recovery — heal any wounds from the Quest. |
| 3 | Emotional grounding — a memory surfaces from your destroyed world. |
| 4 | Social bonding — deepen your relationship with another bonded pair in the band. |
| 5 | Environmental connection — you notice something about this place that others missed. |
| 6 | Spiritual renewal — your shard glows brighter. +1 to your next roll. |

**Optional ritual:** During this step, encourage players to:
- Actually take a snack break
- Step outside for air
- Play quiet music together
- Share something real about their day

The game is a wellness practice disguised as an adventure. This step is where that truth is most visible.

---

### STEP 7: HIT THE FIELDS (D10 — Chaos/Willpower)

*"Time to play. Not quest-play. PLAY-play. Run, compete, invent, laugh."*

Competitive and social mini-games. This is the shard's time to shine — D10 (Mind) is the primary die here.

**What happens:**
- The Storyteller offers a mini-game, sport, or social challenge
- These are FUN — low stakes, high energy

**Mini-Game Options:**

| Game | How to Play |
|------|-------------|
| **Crystal Bowling** | Each player rolls D10. Highest total across 3 rolls wins. |
| **Riddle Ring** | One player asks a riddle. Others have 60 seconds. Anyone who answers rolls D10 — 7+ means their answer is "correct enough" for a reward. |
| **Sound Duel** | Two musicians face off. Each rolls D10+D12. Highest total wins bragging rights and a small reward. |
| **Story Slam** | Each player tells a 1-minute story from their shard's memories. Group votes on the most moving. Winner gets +1 on their next roll. |
| **HalfBall** | A simplified sport: roll D10 three times. Score = total. Highest score wins the match. |

**Why this step matters:** Chaos (D10) is the element of social life, improvisation, and play. This step teaches that play — real, free, joyful play — is as important as questing.

### STEP 8: MAP THE NODES (D100 — Order/Focus)

*"Where have we been? Where are we going? What did we learn?"*

Reflection and evaluation. This is where the band takes stock.

**What happens:**
- The Storyteller asks each player: **"What did you learn today?"**
- Each player shares one insight, lesson, or discovery from the session
- The group maps their journey (literally — drawing on a shared map is encouraged)

**Order Check (D100):**
Each player rolls **percentile dice** (or two D10s read as tens and ones). Compare to your current Order score:

- **Roll ≤ Order Score:** You gain a flash of insight. The Storyteller reveals one hidden truth about the story.
- **Roll > Order Score:** The pattern eludes you. But your Order score increases by 1 (you're learning).

**If you don't have a D100:** Roll two D10s — one for the tens digit, one for the ones digit. 00 = 100.

Your **Order Score** starts equal to your Karma value (see Appendix A) and grows slowly through play. It represents your growing intelligence — your ability to see the pattern behind the patterns.

---

### STEP 9: GET THE YIELDS (D2 — Coin/Instinct)

*"The harvest. What did this adventure produce?"*

Rewards and payouts. The Storyteller distributes the fruits of the session.

**What happens:**
- The Storyteller names the rewards earned through play
- Each player flips the coin (D2) to determine their **Wealth check**

**Wealth Check:**

Your Wealth state is either **Flow** or **Scarcity** (see Chapter 11).

| State | Coin Flip Result | Outcome |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| **Flow** | Heads OR Tails | You receive the full reward. Abundance flows through you regardless. |
| **Scarcity** | Heads only | You receive the reward. |
| **Scarcity** | Tails | You receive half the reward. Something was lost, taxed, or stolen. |

**Possible Rewards:**
- Crystal fragments (for crafting)
- Information (map pieces, song fragments, NPC contacts)
- Reputation (faction standing changes)
- Shard growth (ability increases — see Chapter 11)
- Story items (objects that advance the campaign)

**Wealth State Changes:**
- If you **gave something away freely** during the session → shift toward Flow
- If you **hoarded or refused to share** → shift toward Scarcity
- The Storyteller tracks this. Generosity is rewarded. Hoarding is not punished — it simply constricts.

---

### STEP 10: CLOSING (D12 — Ether/Sound)

*"The music softens. The shards dim to a gentle glow. The day is done."*

The session ends as it began — with music.

**What happens:**
- Each musician player describes (or performs) a closing musical moment
- Go around the table. Each player shares:
  1. **One thing their character is grateful for** from today's adventure
  2. **One thing they're looking forward to** next session

**The Closing Roll (D12):** (Optional — for groups who want a narrative hook)
The Storyteller rolls D12 in secret. This determines the **omen** for next session:

| Roll | Omen |
|------|------|
| 1-4 | Quiet — next session begins peacefully |
| 5-8 | Stirring — something from today's quest has consequences |
| 9-11 | Urgent — a new threat or opportunity appears before next session |
| 12 | Revelation — between sessions, one shard has a vision of their destroyed world |

**Screens off. Dice down. Gratitude spoken. See you next time.**

# PART FOUR: THE DICE GODZ SYSTEM

---

## Chapter 9: The Eight Elements

CrySword SAGA uses the **TEK8 system** — eight elements, each represented by a die. These are not just game mechanics. They are a way of understanding the world:

```
THE TEK8 LOTUS
═══════════════════════════════════════════

                    D12 (Ether)
                   Sound / Culture
                      ╱    ╲
                    ╱        ╲
          D8 (Air)             D4 (Fire)
       Touch/Wisdom           Sight/Craft
              │                    │

              │                    │
       D20 (Water)            D2 (Coin)
      Taste/Empathy         Instinct/Exchange
                    ╲        ╱
                      ╲    ╱
          D6 (Earth)          D100 (Order)
       Smell/Endurance     Intelligence/Focus
                      ╲    ╱
                    D10 (Chaos)
                   Mind / Willpower

═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Complete Element Reference

| Die | Element | Sense | Ability | Role in Game |
|-----|---------|-------|---------|--------------|
| D4 | Fire | Sight | Agility | Crafting, transformation, quick action |
| D6 | Earth | Smell | Endurance | Rest, healing, grounding, defense |
| D8 | Air | Touch | Strength | Gathering, exploration, physical challenges |
| D10 | Chaos | Mind | Willpower | Social play, adaptation, mental challenges |
| D12 | Ether | Sound | Creativity | Music, art, communication, opening/closing |
| D20 | Water | Taste | Empathy | Questing, healing, emotional challenges |
| D100 | Order | Intelligence | Focus | Evaluation, learning, pattern recognition |
| D2 | Coin | Instinct | Wealth | Choices, commerce, beginning/ending |

### The Core Insight

No die is better than another. The **attainment system** (explained next) ensures that a D4 roll is exactly as meaningful as a D20 roll. The smallest die and the largest die carry equal weight. This is a **polyculture of dice** — like an ecosystem where every species matters.

---

## Chapter 10: How to Roll: The Attainment System

When you need to resolve an action, you roll the **appropriate die** and calculate your **attainment**:

```
ATTAINMENT = Roll ÷ Die Maximum × 100%
```

**Examples:**

| Roll | Die | Attainment | Quality |
|------|-----|------------|---------|
| 3 | D4 | 75% | Good |
| 4 | D6 | 67% | Decent |
| 6 | D8 | 75% | Good |
| 8 | D10 | 80% | Great |
| 9 | D12 | 75% | Good |
| 15 | D20 | 75% | Good |

Notice: **a 3 on a D4 is just as good as a 15 on a D20.** Both are 75% attainment. This means your Fire character with only a D4 is not weaker than a Water character with a D20 — they are *differently attuned*.

### Attainment Thresholds

| Attainment | Result | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 0-24% | Failure | It doesn't work. Something goes wrong. |
| 25-49% | Partial | It works, but with a cost or complication. |
| 50-74% | Success | It works as intended. |
| 75-89% | Great Success | It works well. Bonus effect (Storyteller describes). |
| 90-99% | Critical | Exceptional result. Unlock a story reward. |
| 100% | Perfect | Maximum roll. Something extraordinary happens. |

### When to Roll

Only roll when:
- The outcome is uncertain
- Both success and failure are interesting
- A specific die is called for by the Crystal Cycle step

**You do NOT roll for:** walking, talking, eating, sleeping, or any routine action. Save the dice for moments that matter.

---

## Chapter 11: Abilities & Growth

### The Six Core Abilities

Each of the six rolled dice maps to an ability:

| Ability | Die | What It Governs |
|---------|-----|-----------------|
| **Creativity** | D12 | Artistic expression, improvisation, inspiring others |
| **Strength** | D8 | Physical power, carrying capacity, endurance in combat |
| **Agility** | D4 | Speed, dexterity, crafting precision, reflexes |
| **Empathy** | D20 | Understanding others, healing, diplomacy, memory |
| **Endurance** | D6 | Stamina, patience, resistance to hardship, grounding |
| **Willpower** | D10 | Mental resilience, persuasion, psychic power, adaptation |

### The Two Emergent Stats

These are never rolled during character creation. They emerge from play:

**ORDER (D100 — Focus/Intelligence)**

- **Starting Score:** Begin at 50 (or use Karma calculation from full rules — see Appendix D)
- **Grows through:** Study, contemplation, teaching others, recognizing patterns
- **Shrinks through:** Willful ignorance, reckless chaos without reflection
- **Used for:** Insight checks, knowledge checks, evaluating situations
- **How to check:** Roll D100. If you roll ≤ your Order score, you succeed.

**WEALTH (D2 — Instinct/Abundance)**

- **Starting State:** Flow (if your character has given something away during creation) or Scarcity (if not)
- **Shifts toward Flow:** Through generosity, reciprocity, serving others
- **Shifts toward Scarcity:** Through hoarding, extraction, selfishness
- **Used for:** Trade, resource discovery, lucky breaks
- **How to check:** Flip a coin. In Flow, you succeed on either result. In Scarcity, you succeed on Heads only.

### Growing Your Character

Characters grow through the Crystal Cycle. Each completed session:

1. **One ability of your choice increases by 1 point** (max 20 per ability)
2. **Order Score may change** (based on Step 8 results)
3. **Wealth State may flip** (based on generosity/hoarding during the session)
4. **Shard memories unlock** (the Storyteller reveals new fragments of your destroyed world)
5. **New songs are learned** (the band's repertoire grows)

Growth is not fast. It is not meant to be. Like a crystal, you grow slowly and with purpose.

# PART FIVE: THE WORLD OF PLAY

---

## Chapter 12: The Eight Guilds

The territories between the broken worlds and Saraswati are organized by eight **guilds** — communities of specialists who each serve a different element. Your shard-musician pair may join one guild, drawing on its resources and contributing to its mission.

| Die | Guild Name | Focus | What They Do |
|-----|------------|-------|--------------|
| D12 | **Sonic Assemblers** | Sound & Culture | Create music, preserve songs, perform healing ceremonies |
| D8 | **Translators & Teachers** | Wisdom & Communication | Educate, translate between species, record knowledge |
| D4 | **Smiths & Tinkerers** | Innovation & Craft | Build tools, forge CrySwords, engineer solutions |
| D20 | **Storykeepers & Healers** | Memory & Empathy | Heal the wounded, recover lost histories, counsel |
| D6 | **Grounders & Growers** | Earth & Stewardship | Farm crystal gardens, tend to land, provide food |
| D10 | **Tricksters & Remixers** | Chaos & Social Life | Organize games, challenge assumptions, spark change |
| D100 | **Archivists & Codemakers** | Order & Systems | Map territories, maintain records, govern fairly |
| D2 | **Weavers & Distributors** | Exchange & Commerce | Facilitate trade, distribute resources, balance the economy |

### Guild Benefits

Joining a guild grants:
- **+1 to rolls** using your guild's die
- **Access to guild resources** (workshops, libraries, gardens, etc.)
- **A guild quest** — a long-term mission assigned by guild elders
- **Community** — other shard-musician pairs who share your calling

You may only belong to **one guild at a time**, but you may change guilds between sessions if the story supports it.

## Chapter 13: Sacred Instruments

Every musician in CrySword SAGA plays a **Sacred Instrument** — their primary tool of creative expression and the channel through which the crystal shard's power flows. You don't need to be a master musician. **Intention matters more than skill.**

## Chapter 15: The Three Factions

The territories are contested by three factions. Each embodies a partial truth:

### The Freecrystal Alliance (Liberation)

Shards and musicians who escaped destruction and committed to sharing everything. Resources flow freely. Decisions are made by consensus.

- **Strength:** Solidarity, diversity, Queen Mab's blessing
- **Weakness:** Slow decision-making, vulnerable to infiltration
- **Belief:** "The commons belongs to all."

### The Lattice Imperium (Order)

Shards who escaped but built rigid hierarchies for safety. Each layer more compressed and powerful than the one below.

- **Strength:** Efficiency, military discipline, powerful crystal technology
- **Weakness:** They recreate the very patterns that destroyed the homeworlds
- **Belief:** "Security requires structure."

### The Null Collective (Chaos)

Shards who reject both commons and hierarchy. Radical individualists. Temporary alliances only.

- **Strength:** Unpredictability, innovation, fearlessness
- **Weakness:** Can't coordinate, easily co-opted individually
- **Belief:** "No system should constrain us again."

### The Truth

Each faction is right about something. The Alliance has the ethics but struggles with scale. The Imperium has the scale but loses the ethics. The Collective has the spirit of freedom but can't build anything lasting. **The game teaches: all three are needed in balance** — just as all eight elements must coexist.

Your band can align with any faction, play factions against each other, or try to bridge them. This is your story.

---

# PART SIX: RUNNING THE GAME

---

## Chapter 16: For the Storyteller

You are the **Storyteller** — the person who sets the scene, voices the NPCs, presents the challenges, and keeps the Crystal Cycle moving.

### Your Responsibilities

1. **Flip the coin** (Step 1) to open each session
2. **Describe the world** — make it vivid, strange, and beautiful
3. **Present challenges** that require different dice (not just D20)
4. **Track the Crystal Cycle** — keep the group moving through all 10 steps
5. **Reveal shard memories** — drip-feed clues about the destroyed worlds
6. **Play fair** — the dice decide outcomes, not your preference
7. **Close with ceremony** (Step 10) — end on gratitude

### The Most Important Rule

**Every session should complete the full Crystal Cycle.** If you're running out of time, compress Steps 3-4 (Gather/Craft) into quick montages. Never skip Steps 1, 2, 9, and 10 — the opening coin flip, the music, the rewards, and the closing ceremony are what give the game its ritual quality.

### Three Storyteller Principles

1. **Follow the music.** If a player does something creative with their instrument (real or fictional), reward it. The game is about sound.
2. **Honor the shard.** The crystal shards are people — ancient, wise, vulnerable. They are not inventory items. They have feelings and memories.
3. **Touch all elements.** A good session uses all 8 dice at least once. If Air (D8) hasn't been rolled, create a moment that requires Gathering. If Chaos (D10) hasn't been tested, offer a mini-game. The cycle ensures balance.

---

## Chapter 17: Your First Session

Here is a complete first-session guide — follow this step by step:

### Before Play

- Each player creates a **shard** (see Chapter 4): name, zodiac world, element, one memory, one song fragment
- The Storyteller prepares the **setting**: the band is scattered across a windswept territory, each shard lying dormant, waiting

### Session Flow

**STEP 1: INSERT COIN**
Storyteller flips a coin. "Welcome to the Peoples Arcade. This coin activates your story."

**STEP 2: THE MUSIC BEGINS — THE BOND**
This is the special first-session version. Each shard finds its musician:

> *"You lie among the rubble of a world that is not your own. Dust. Wind. Silence. Then — a sound. A note, tentative, curious. Someone is playing nearby. The vibration reaches you and your crystal lattice sings in response. A face appears. Hands lift you. Eyes widen. The bond forms."*

Each player:
1. Chooses their Sacred Instrument (Chapter 13)
2. Names their musician
3. Describes the moment of bonding
4. Rolls D12 for Musical Resonance (see Step 2 chart)

**STEP 3: GATHER**
The newly bonded pairs explore their surroundings. What do they find? Each rolls D8.

**STEP 4: CRAFT & TRADE**
Using what they found, each pair crafts one item. Roll D4.

**STEP 5: QUEST — "The Signal"**
The Storyteller presents the first quest:

> *"All shards in the area are vibrating at the same frequency. A signal. It's coming from beyond the dust storms, from a structure half-buried in crystal sand. Something — or someone — is broadcasting a song. The song is old. Older than any of your homeworlds. Do you follow it?"*

The quest involves:
- Traveling through a dust storm (D8 Strength check)
- Deciphering the signal (D10 Willpower check)
- Entering the buried structure (D4 Agility check)
- Discovering what's inside (D20 Empathy check — it's a dormant shard, enormous, dreaming of a world that might be Saraswati itself)

**STEP 6: SMELL THE FLOWERS**
The band rests near the buried structure. Each rolls D6.

**STEP 7: HIT THE FIELDS**
A playful moment — maybe the musicians jam together for the first time, or the shards play a psychic game of riddles.

**STEP 8: MAP THE NODES**
Where are we? What have we learned? Draw a rough map. Roll D100 for insight.

**STEP 9: GET THE YIELDS**
Each player flips a coin. The Storyteller distributes:
- A crystal fragment (for future crafting)
- A clue about the dormant mega-shard
- Reputation: the band is now known in this territory

**STEP 10: CLOSING**
Music. Gratitude. What are you looking forward to next time?

## Chapter 18: Adventure Hooks

One hook for each element — use them in any order:

### Fire Hook: The Burning Archive
A Smiths & Tinkerers forge is on fire — not physical fire, but a resonance overload. Crystal weapons are generating themselves uncontrollably. Someone must enter the forge and restore balance before the whole territory destabilizes.

### Earth Hook: The Silent Garden
A Grounders & Growers crystal garden has stopped producing. The plants are alive but silent — no resonance, no growth. Something underground is absorbing all the elemental energy. Dig down to find what.

### Air Hook: The Lost Translation
A message was intercepted between two factions — but it's in a language no one speaks. The Translators & Teachers believe it's from one of the Zodiac Worlds. Decode it, and learn something crucial about the road to Saraswati.

### Water Hook: The Memory Flood
A shard has been recovered from a wreck, but when anyone touches it, they are overwhelmed by memories that aren't their own — decades of life on a destroyed world, compressed into seconds. The Storykeepers need someone to carefully extract and preserve these memories without drowning in them.

### Chaos Hook: The Trickster's Gambit
A member of the Null Collective is offering a deal: they know a shortcut through contested territory, but they want something in return — a song. Specifically, YOUR song. The one your shard has been humming since you woke up. What is it worth?

### Ether Hook: The Instrument That Plays Itself
A Sacred Instrument has been found — a harp made of living crystal — that plays music on its own. Beautiful music. Haunting music. Music that makes shards vibrate with homesickness. But the instrument has no musician bond. It's playing for someone who isn't there. Who?

### Order Hook: The Map That Changes
An Archivist has discovered a map of the territories that updates itself in real time — but it shows territories that don't exist yet. Places that WILL exist, if certain conditions are met. The map is a prophecy. But prophecies can be traps.

### Coin Hook: The Wishing Well
In the center of a trading post, there's a well. Drop a crystal fragment in, and it grants a wish — but someone else's wish is taken away. The well is perfectly fair and perfectly cruel. The Weavers want to destroy it. The Tricksters want to study it. What does your band do?

---

## Chapter 19: Campaign Structure

A CrySword SAGA campaign is a journey — from the broken worlds to the Saraswati Supercluster. It has three acts:

### Act 1: Awakening (Sessions 1-5)

The band forms. Shards find musicians. First bonds are tested.

- **Focus:** Learning the system, bonding, exploring nearby territories
- **Key Question:** Who are we, and why are we together?
- **Climax:** The band discovers they are all heading the same direction — toward a signal from Saraswati

### Act 2: Discovery (Sessions 6-15)

The band travels deeper into the territories. Faction conflicts intensify. Shard memories surface.

- **Focus:** Guild membership, faction politics, recovering memories
- **Key Question:** What were our worlds, and why were they destroyed?
- **Climax:** A mutual shatter event — two CrySwords break against each other and open a portal. The first glimpse of Saraswati.

### Act 3: Reunion (Sessions 16-25+)

The band approaches the Saraswati Supercluster. The music reaches its crescendo.

- **Focus:** Uniting factions, mastering all elements, composing the final song
- **Key Question:** Can we build something new without repeating the patterns that destroyed the old?
- **Climax:** Harmonic convergence — all shards vibrate in unison, all instruments play together, the portal to Saraswati opens fully

**After the campaign:** Characters may continue in the Saraswati Supercluster with new adventures, or players may start fresh with new shards from new worlds. The Quillverse is infinite.

## Appendix C: Cultural Sharing Guidelines

CrySword SAGA draws inspiration from many traditions — Vedic philosophy, Indigenous ecological knowledge, Polynesian navigation, Chinese divination, African percussion traditions, and more. We hold these with respect:

**What this game IS:**
- A creative framework that draws structural inspiration from diverse knowledge systems
- An invitation to learn about traditions you may not have encountered
- A game that believes every culture has wisdom to share

**What this game IS NOT:**
- A claim to possess or transmit actual Traditional Ecological Knowledge
- A substitute for learning from primary sources and real communities
- Cultural extraction disguised as entertainment

**Our commitments:**
- We credit our intellectual lineage (sources listed in every document)
- We direct players toward primary sources — the actual books, peoples, and places where these traditions live
- We practice reciprocity — if the framework benefits from indigenous conceptual architecture, benefits should flow back to indigenous communities

**Recommended reading:**
- Winona LaDuke, *"Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Environmental Futures"* (1994)
- Robin Wall Kimmerer, *Braiding Sweetgrass* (2013)
- Gregory Cajete, *Native Science: Natural Laws of Interdependence* (2000)
- Linda Tuhiwai Smith, *Decolonizing Methodologies* (2021)

## Appendix D: What Comes Next

This zine presents a **simplified version** of the Dice Godz system — enough to play complete, satisfying campaigns of CrySword SAGA.

The full system, currently in development and coming in 2026, includes:

- **The Godz World Egg (GWE):** A complete character creation ritual where you roll 6 dice across ~11 sets to build a 360-degree elemental composition — the most detailed RPG character creation ever designed
- **The Birth Hexagram:** Your final GWE roll produces an I Ching hexagram that maps 1:1 to one of 64 Gemstone Species — your shard's true identity
- **The Numerology System:** Personal Resonance Numbers, three tiers of resonance that let your lucky numbers affect gameplay
- **The Astrology System:** Stellarium integration for a pluriversal Birth Sky — characters born under multiple star traditions simultaneously
- **The Six Opulences of Bhagavan:** A soul-level attribute system drawn from Vedic philosophy
- **The 64 Gemstone Species:** The full taxonomy of crystal shard species, mapped to elements, petals, and hexagrams
- **Advanced Attainment Mechanics:** Combat, magic, exploration, and social systems built on the percentage-based attainment framework
