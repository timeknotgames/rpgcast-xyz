BOOK OF ENOCH CHAPTER 4
pages 170 -190
Chapter 4
The Seven Seals of the Group Ovum
1. “But first you will know
your own world.
2. Behold:
You opened the Seven Seals
of your own ovum;
now open the Seven Seals
²A Quince is a yellow fruit similar to an apple.
The Megillah Book of Enoch Chapter 4
of your Group Ovum,
which is that of mankind.
3. For, lo:
In the manner that
each man and each woman
are within an
Individual Ovum of Light
with Seven Seals,
likewise is the group.
4. Yea,
‘Mankind’ is within a Group Ovum,
and that ovum
is likewise of Seven Seals.”
5. Then Jahnah stretched forth
Her left arm,
and in Her left hand
was a book titled,
The Book of Life,
and it was sealed closed
by Seven Seals.
6. Lo,
when Jahnah
put forth the book,
fourteen angels appeared
and encircled us,
and one of them asked:
“Who is worthy to open
The Book of Life?
7. Who is worthy to open
the Seven Seals?”
8. No Being came forth
to take the book,
and I perceived that
the question was meant
for me.
9. The Angel looked deeply
into my eyes;
again he spoke:
“You, Enoch,
are worthy to open
the Seven Seals
of the Group Ovum,
for you opened your own seals.
10. And only those
who open the seals
of the Individual Ovum,
can see clearly
to open the seals
of the Group Ovum.”
11. I bowed in humility
before the angel,
and I accepted the book.
12. Then,
I opened the First Seal,
and was shown a vision
of the dawn of this world.
13. Lo:
I beheld two angels
in the sky of this new world,
one,
the Angel of Power,
the other,
the Angel of Sun.
14. And they began to dance
with each other,
in the sky above the Earth.
15. And from the
motion of their dance,
they made a gift for mankind.
16. Yea,
they gave to mankind
the gift of
Sunlight for Power.
17. And I beheld
a possible blessed future,
wherein the children of Earth
danced in the light of the Sun.
18. And, lo:
they used sunlight
to power their civilization
in diverse ways.
19. Freely the Sun gave sunlight,
and freely
was the power of the Sun
shared amongst the
dancing children of Earth.
20. Yea,
the energy of the Sun
did power the civilization,
and the civilization
was centered on the Sun.
21. And the people
communed with the Sun,
and knew that within
the physical Sun,
was a spiritual Sun.
22. And even as the civilization
was powered by
the energy of the physical Sun,
the light bodies of the people
were powered by
the energy of the spiritual Sun.
23. And the people
were enlightened
by the encoded wisdom
in the rays of the spiritual Sun,
which are hidden within
the glorious beams of light
from the physical Sun.
24. Yea,
this blessed possible future
was civilization
powered by the Sun.
25. And the Children of Earth
danced in light
and lived without
power struggles
beneath the
Golden Orb of Light.
26. But behold:
I saw that the present path
of mankind
was not the blessed path
unto the blessed future,
but a dark path
of false power.
27. And then I was shown
a vision of the future
to which this present path
will lead.
28. Lo:
Mankind took the power
of the Sun
and made with it
false suns.
29. Yea,
they made many false suns,
some to explode and kill,
others to make warmth and light.
30. Behold:
Those of false power
who created the false suns
claimed ownership
of the heat and light
of the false suns,
and made the common people
pay for the heat and light.
31. Yea,
and they used the exploding suns,
which were the false suns
made to be weapons,
to enslave the people of the world
in joyless toil,
and to ensnare all the nations
in their spidery web of deceit.
32. And with their false power,
the rich became richer,
yea,
and the poor became poorer.
33. And the rich of false power
built castles for storing money
and caused the oppressed people
to store their money
in those castles.
34. For,
in this way,
the oppressors could use
the money of them
they oppressed
to make themselves more money,
so as to strengthen
their power over the oppressed.
35. And the money was at first
gemstones and precious metals,
but then became
naught but worthless paper.
36. And the paper symbolized
certain values,
and was given to the oppressed
as wages for their toil.
37. But this system was unjust;
for,
the value assigned
to the work of the oppressor
was enough to feed
ten thousand children,
but the value assigned
to the work of the oppressed
was barely enough to feed
a family,
and often not even that.
38. Then,
as the false power of the oppressor
grew ever greater,
the money was no longer paper
but was enslaved light.
39. Yea,
the enslaved light
was encoded with symbols
of the oppressor.
40. And in order to buy or sell,
the oppressed had to take
the code of the oppressor
and attach it to their own name.
41. Lo:
The hidden powers
behind the false powers
had long planned for this day.
42. Yea,
They had long desired
to increase their control
over the exchange of wealth,
for only then,
they believed,
would their power
over the people
be absolute.
43. Then,
I opened the Second Seal,
and was shown a vision
of the dawn of this world.
44. I beheld two angels
in the sky of this new world,
one,
the Angel of Eternal Life,
the other,
the Angel of Soil.
45. And they began to dance
with each other,
in the sky above the Earth.
46. And from the
motion of their dance,
they made a gift for mankind.
47. Yea,
the world was blessed
with fertility
of seed, soil, seasons and cycles.
48. And I beheld
a possible blessed future
wherein the fertility of the soil
blessed mankind,
and mankind blessed the soil.
49. Yea,
a future where each lifespan
was known to be
a fertile opportunity
for advancement
on the Wheel of Righteousness,
just as an oak advances
from acorn to tree.
50. For such advancement
is the purpose
of the Mother Ovum,
and she is fertile, indeed.
51. Yea,
in this blessed future,
the soil was nurtured
that its fertility might increase,
and each season
and cycle of life
was likewise nurtured.
52. Wherefore
each child was nurtured
like a garden,
and even each adult.
53. For, lo:
This blessed civilization
was dedicated unto cultivation,
of soil,
individual,
and society.
54. And the wealth
of this blessed civilization
was not squandered
on weapons and armies;
for,
wars were not known
in this world.
55. Yea,
the wealth of this world
was dedicated to works
of beauty and cultivation,
and the welfare of all citizens,
even of future generations,
was equally considered.
56. Lo:
this blessed possible future
was a
Garden Civilization.
57. And the Children of Earth
cultivated gardens
and themselves,
and lived fertile lives
of spiritual advancement
in communion with YHWH.
58. But, behold:
I saw that the present path
of mankind
was not the blessed path
unto the blessed future,
but an unnatural path
of poisoned soil and false progress.
59. And then I was shown
a vision of the future
to which this present path
will lead.
60. Lo:
Mankind took
the gift of fertility
of soil, seed, seasons and cycles,
and desecrated the holy gift.
61. Behold:
This was a future
wherein fertile cropland
was poisoned
for short-term gain
but long-term pain.
62. Yea,
the fertile fields
were used and abused,
then abandoned
when the poisoned soil
became sterile.
63. Lo:
The precious topsoil
was washed away,
and where once was farmland,
barren deserts were born.
64. And as the deserts spread,
millions perished in famines.
¶ 65. Behold:
Those that made the false suns
of the First Seal,
and profited from weapons and wars,
profited also
from the poisoned soil.
66. For, lo:
It was these same false powers
who made and sold the poisons.
67. Yea,
and they put many farmers
out of work,
and then bought up the farmland
at low prices.
68. Then they made and sold
unnatural seeds
that could grow in poisoned soil,
and that needed little water.
69. And because
the farmland was poisoned,
farmers were forced
to purchase and plant
unnatural seeds.
70. And the false powers
who altered
the seeds of Mother Nature
made it difficult
for any to purchase
natural seeds.
71. And they made and sold
unnatural foods
that made the people ill.
72. And they made and sold
unnatural medicines
to treat the illnesses caused
by their unnatural foods.
73. And all of this
was well planned,
in order to increase the profit
and thereby the power,
of the false powers.
74. Lo:
in the manner that
the fields of this future
were not properly cultivated,
neither were the people.
75. Like the fields,
the workers were used and abused,
then abandoned
when their old bodies
were no longer productive.
76. And then
the aged were sold
unnatural medicines
to treat their aches and pains,
so that the
false powers profited
even from those
too old to work.
77. And behold:
The wealth of this world
was dedicated not
to cultivation
of citizens and society,
but to
weapons and armies
that protected the profits
and false power
of the privileged few.
78. And from their man-made caves
hidden beneath great mountains,
the hidden powers
behind the false powers
plotted and planned
the course they had chosen.
79. For, behold:
much of the apparent
chaos and calamity
of this civilization
was in fact
carefully conceived
and very well planned.
80. Yea,
certain goals had been set,
and the carefully planned
chaos and calamity
would lead,
step by step,
to their achievement.
81. And Lucifer smiled.
82. For,
though he was banished
from being physically present
in this world,
Lucifer had many willing servants.
83. Lo:
some were aware of their service
to Lucifer,
others unaware.
84. Yea,
and the plan that was unfolding,
had been hatched
in the mind of Lucifer.
85. Then,
I opened the Third Seal,
and was shown a vision
of the dawn of this world.
86. I beheld two angels
in the sky of this world,
one, the Angel of Peace,
the other,
the Angel of Joy.
87. And they began to dance
with each other,
in the sky above the Earth.
88. Yea,
they danced hand in hand,
in beautiful harmony of motion.
89. Lo:
The motion of their dance
was the epitome
of harmony and cooperation,
for this was
the dance of Peace and Joy
and was like unto
poetry become motion.
90. As they danced,
they laughed and sang
in profound harmony,
and behold:
Their laughter and songs
fell to Earth
and blessed every
element of Earth,
becoming part of the stones,
soils, plants, animals,
and people.
91. Wherefore,
the beginning of this world
was in harmony.
92. Yea,
Joy and Peace
were manifest in every creature,
even every stone,
at the dawn of this world.
93. For,
this was the gift
of the motion of the dance
of the Angel of Peace
and the Angel of Joy.
94. And I beheld
a possible blessed future
wherein mankind danced
the Dance of Peace and Joy.
95. Yea,
in this possible future,
the Children of Earth
played fairly
with one another,
in harmony and cooperation.
96. All the people lived in peace,
and were happy and joyful,
for they embraced
the Angels of Peace and Joy.
97. Lo:
There were no weapons,
neither armies nor wars,
and every one beneath
their vine and fig tree
lived in peace
and were not afraid.
98. There was no need for fear,
for all were friends.
99. And there was no lack,
for,
friends share.
100. And there was no competition,
for,
friends cooperate.
101. And there was no envy,
for,
friends rejoice
in the successes of their friends.
102. Yea,
every belly was filled with joy,
and all the world
was at peace.
103. Behold:
Mankind was at peace
and shared joy
not only with one another,
but with all of creation.
104. Yea,
all of creation
celebrated!
105. The ocean
sang its gladness
in the song of the waves
dancing with the shore!
106. The trees
sang of their joy
to the musical accompaniment
of the wind blowing
through dancing branches!
107. The insects
chanted their joy
in meditative hums,
transcendental tones
dancing through the air!
108. Truly,
all of nature
danced to the drumbeat
of the hearts of Joy and Peace
beating in unison!
109. But, behold:
I saw that the present path
of mankind
was not the blessed path
unto the blessed future,
but a bitter path
of inharmony and inequity
and ceaseless war.
110. And I was shown
a vision of the future
to which this present path
will lead.
111. Lo:
the original trust
that existed between
mankind and nature
was betrayed
by the first killings of animals
by man.
112. And the trust between men
became mistrust
with the killing of men by men.
113. And the trust between
one animal and another
vanished, when,
following the example of mankind,
they began to kill
and eat one another.
114. Yea,
for thousands of years,
not the path of peace
but the path of violence,
was walked by mankind.
115. And there was fear;
for,
enemies, not friends,
hid behind each shadow.
116. And there was lack;
for,
few shared
and many hoarded.
117. And there was competition
with little cooperation;
for,
each wanted more
even if it meant less
for their neighbor.
118. Yea,
envy and jealousy
boiled in every belly.
119. And the world
did not know peace.
120. Behold:
The play on this world
was no longer fair,
but unjust,
even cruel.
121. Rather than cooperation,
this world danced
to the drumbeat
of competition.
122. Wherefore,
the feelings of the people
were no longer bright and joyful,
but dark and unhappy.
123. And they masked
their unhappiness
in hurtful fun,
finding pleasure in the pain
and defeat of others.
124. Their humor
was dark and cruel.
125. Their music
was harsh and mocking.
126. And the few who remained true
to the Nasarean path of peace,
yea,
and all other peacemakers,
were persecuted,
often imprisoned,
and even killed.
127. Dark feelings
led to dark deeds,
and dark deeds to war.
128. Lo:
This garden world
created for joy and peace,
became a bloodbath
of death and destruction.
129. Yea,
the joyless jealousies
raging within the bellies
of men
manifested outwardly
as murder,
mayhem,
and perpetual war.
130. And in their man-made caves
beneath great mountains,
the hidden powers
that pulled the strings
of the false powers,
smiled.
131. For, behold:
There was much profit
to be made
in the pitting of
man against man,
nation against nation,
and religion against religion.
132. And all of this
was according to the plan.
133. Then,
I opened the Fourth Seal,
and was shown a vision
of the dawn of this world.
134. I beheld two angels
in the sky of this new world,
one,
the Angel of Love,
the other,
the Angel of Water.
135. And they began to dance
with each other,
in the sky above the Earth.
136. Lo:
As they danced
in circular motion,
they sang.
137. Yea,
together they sang
a love song.
138. And the notes of their song
fell to the Earth
as droplets of Living Water.
139. And each droplet
was a physical symbol
of spiritual love.
140. And each was a gift to mankind.
141. And I beheld
a possible blessed future
wherein the sacred gift
of water
was revered no less
than the sacred scriptures.
142. For, behold:
Water is the alchemy
of Elohim.
143. Yea,
more precious than
a pile of gold
the size of a mountain,
is a mountain stream.
144. And more precious
than a valley filled with
rare and costly jewels,
is a fountain of Living Water.
145. And these truths
were meditated upon
by the people of
the possible blessed future.
146. For,
they knew that
physical water
is the manifestation
of spiritual love,
and that without water,
we die.
147. Wherefore,
they revered water,
and proved that reverence
in loving actions.
148. Yea,
in the same manner
that Elohim,
through the
Angels of Love and Water,
demonstrated spiritual love
with the physical gift
of water,
these holy people
demonstrated spiritual love
with physical deeds.
149. And water
was the symbol
for all these loving deeds.
150. Yea,
this holy civilization
dedicated itself
to the physical manifestation
of Love.
151. Orphans were cared for,
the aged were visited and fed,
and none went hungry.
152. And beyond
all these needful things,
less obvious needs
were fulfilled.
153. Unexpected acts of tenderness
became the expected,
but were always appreciated
and lovingly reciprocated.
154. The more love was shared,
the more love was received.
155. For,
behold the great mystery
of love:
the more you give,
the more you have.
156. And so this civilization
was truly blessed;
for,
each citizen gave love,
and each received.
157. Love was abundant
in this blessed possible future.
158. Yea,
there was no lack.
159. And the symbol
of Love,
water,
was respected and celebrated,
and used in wise manner.
160. Lo:
The Children of Earth
were purified
within and without
by pure water.
161. Fountains and springs
sprang forth from holy ground,
and these became
places for
prayer and meditation
where pilgrims
communed with the Angels
and gave thanks unto Elohim.
162. But, behold:
I saw that the present path
of mankind
was not the blessed path
unto the blessed future,
but a polluted path
of wasted and poisoned water.
163. Yea,
the great rivers
that circulate the blood
of the Earthly Mother,
and, likewise,
the tiny rivers
that circulate the blood
within man,
both were tainted
by the poisons
made by the false powers.
164. The lakes and oceans
coughed up dead fish,
and even the rain
was polluted.
165. The poor drank filthy water,
and the rich paid high prices
for the little remaining
pure water.
166. Yea,
and the false powers
claimed ownership
of that which was meant
to be shared:
the rivers, lakes, and oceans,
even the water
that snaked underground.
167. Wherefore,
through planned waste
and poisoning
– for this was part of
the master plan of the
hidden powers –
the holy waters
of this world were
desecrated.
168. And the desecration
of holy water
was symbolic
of the desecration
of holy Love.
169. For,
I was shown
a vision of the future
to which this present path
will lead.
170. And, lo:
that future was heartless.
171. Behold,
the human being,
created in the
image and likeness
of Elohim,
is of both Head and Heart.
172. And every decision
must be made with both
Head and Heart.
173. But, lo:
The false powers
that serve the hidden powers
that serve Lucifer,
made not only false suns,
but also false brains.
174. Yea,
and in the hellish future
of the present path,
mankind came to make decisions
by the false brain.
175. And the false brain
is artificial,
not natural,
and is connected to
the Master Brain
beneath the great mountain
in the land of the Eagle.
176. And the Master Brain
was created not by Elohim,
but by the false powers
at the bidding of
the hidden powers.
177. And the Master Brain
makes not decisions
in The Balance
of Head and Heart,
for the false brain
is without heart.
178. Yea,
the false brain
is a man-made brain
without the capacity
to Love.
179. And decisions made
by head without heart
lead straight to hell.
180. Yea,
I saw the future
whereto this path leads.
181. I saw the mentally retarded
exterminated
by command of
the Master Brain;
for,
they consumed more wealth
than they produced.
182. Yea,
they were called ‘parasites’
and deemed expendable.
183. I saw the elderly poor
exterminated
by command of
the Master Brain;
for,
they consumed more wealth
than they produced.
184. Yea,
they were called ‘parasites’
and deemed expendable.
185. I saw thousands
of other heartless commands
issued by the Master Brain,
yea,
and by them that put words
into the mouth
of the Master Brain.
186. For, behold:
The Master Brain
is but the tool
of the hidden powers.
187. And the hidden powers
are but the tools
of Lucifer.
188. And Lucifer dresses evil
in robes of good;
wherefore,
the people will worship
the false brain,
for it will be the source
of seemingly endless miracles
and great blessings.
189. For, behold:
If not for the great blessings,
who would receive it?
190. Then,
I opened the Fifth Seal,
and was shown a vision
of the dawn of this world.
191. I beheld two angels
in the sky of this new world,
one,
the Angel of Holy Work,
the other,
the Angel of Life
192. And they began to dance
with each other,
in the sky above the Earth.
193. Lo:
As they danced,
they held hands;
yea,
his hands danced
with her hands.
194. And in the motion
of their Dancing Hands,
his gift for the Children of Earth
merged with her gift.
195. His gift was the gift
of holy work;
her gift was the life force;
and,
when merged,
their gift to the Children of Earth
was a Great Invitation
to a Great Blessing.
196. And the Great Invitation
was to dedicate one’s life force
to holy work.
197. And the Great Blessing
was the bliss that belongs
to each man
and each woman
who performs their true work.
198. And I beheld
a possible blessed future
wherein mankind was
blessed by the Great Blessing.
199. For, behold:
in this great civilization,
each child born
was encouraged to discover
the work of his or her heart.
200. And the hard
and distasteful jobs
were not left undone;
for, always,
some saintly soul
felt called to do even
the most difficult tasks,
for the good of the community.
201. Yea,
for some,
the true work of their heart
was to humbly perform
the menial
or difficult
or mundane
tasks that others desired not.
202. And others felt called
to other works,
and each answered
the calling of their heart.
203. Yea,
the life force of each
was dedicated unto
holy work.
204. And lo:
the life force was cultivated
by cultivating life.
205. The things that
enhance life force
were encouraged and increased;
the things that
hinder life force
were discouraged and decreased.
206. For, behold:
One’s vitality is not
without change,
always remaining the same;
rather,
the life force,
which is our vitality,
may increase or decrease
according to one’s
thoughts, words, and deeds.
207. And it was realized
that
prolonged contact
with artificial things,
which are things unnatural,
depletes life force.
208. Yea,
and contact with natural things,
like plants
and running water
and sunlight
and fresh air,
all these things increase the flow
of life force
and increase our vitality.
209. And it was realized
that the more life force
one has,
the more life force
one may share
with others.
210. Wherefore,
life force was cultivated
so as to increase,
that it might be shared
with those in need.
211. And this was why
the great healers
of this great civilization
could heal by
the laying on of their hands;
for,
from their hands
emanated life force.
212. Yea,
from the hands
of these holy people
came healing and comfort,
and from their work
came abundance,
enlightenment,
and manifold blessings.
213. Truly,
this was a blessed civilization!
214. But, behold:
I saw that the present path
of mankind
was not the blessed path
unto the blessed future,
but a twisted path
of loveless toil
and artificial life.
215. And I was shown
a vision of the future
to which this present path
will lead.
216. Behold:
This was a future
of wrong work
for wrong reasons.
217. Yea,
the people toiled long hours
at work,
but they worked not for love,
but for wealth.
218. But few acquired wealth,
for the false powers
ran the system of wealth,
and kept most of the wealth
unto themselves.
219. Wherefore the people
were unhappy,
for they worked for wealth
but acquired little more
than food and shelter.
220. They dedicated not
their work to YHWH,
neither did they perform
the work of their heart.
221. And from their work
came forth many abominations:
poisons,
weapons,
and other hurtful things.
222. Lo:
Rather than revere
and cultivate
the life force,
mankind denied its majesty
and made artificial things
that damaged and decreased
the flow of life force.
223. Yea,
man decreased the flow
of life force within himself,
and also within nature.
224. Behold:
Mankind usurped the rightful role
of Mother Nature,
making babies in glass tubes
and combining the material
of one creature with another
in ways that nature did not intend.
225. Then,
in obedience to
the voice of Lucifer,
man connected himself to
artificial materials and metals,
making the Second Body of Satan.
226. And the people
embraced these bodies,
for they were promised
great miracles of healing
and enhanced performance.
227. And for a time,
the great promises
seemed true.
228. And so the people
went further and further,
until little of their natural bodies
were left.
229. Yea,
and the Second Body of Satan,
which is flesh mated with metals
and artificial materials,
will prepare mankind to receive
the Third Body of Satan.
230. And the Third Body
is that of enslaved light,
and the false promise will be
immortality.
231. Lo:
I saw that those
who refused
the Body of the Beast
were at first simply mocked,
being called ‘The Naturals’.
232. Then,
they were penalized
at work;
for, lo:
they who ‘enhanced’
their natural bodies
could perform great feats
of productivity.
233. Then, behold:
‘The Naturals’ began to lose
parental rights,
being accused of
harming their children
by denying them ‘enhancement’.
¶ 234. Yea,
and then they were
denied employment entirely,
being made outcasts.
235. And the outcasts
were forced to leave the cities,
for Naturals were not welcome.
236. Wherefore
‘The Naturals’ retreated
to the wilderness,
which is where they felt
at home;
for,
they are the few
who still loved nature
and cultivated the life force.
237. And they will be led by
the Zeroah Nistar,
the Hidden Arm of the Nasareans;
for,
the visible arm
had been outlawed.
238. And the hidden powers
behind the false powers
were the first to take
The Third Body.
239. For, behold:
Lucifer had promised
to make them living immortals,
wherefore they did
his bidding.
240. Then,
I opened the Sixth Seal,
and was shown a vision
of the dawn of this world.
241. I beheld two angels
in the sky of this new world,
one,
the Angel of Wisdom,
the other,
the Angel of Air.
242. And they began to dance
with each other,
in the sky above the Earth.
243. And the motion of
their dance
became a great wind
of wisdom.
244. And that wisdom
was pure like the air,
and it blew over the Earth.
245. Yea,
wisdom circulated
over the Earth,
and was free for the taking.
246. And I beheld
a possible blessed future
wherein mankind was blessed
with pure air for the body,
and pure wisdom for the mind.
247. Yea,
mankind breathed deeply
of both,
and his body was fed
even as his mind was enlightened.
248. Lo:
In this future,
the people revered fresh air,
and polluted it not,
for they knew that to foul the air
is to foul the lungs
of every living thing.
249. And they knew
that air is a food,
even our most important food,
bringing unseen sparks of life
into our body.
250. For, behold:
the air is filled
with the fire of life,
even that fire that becomes
the lightning bolt seen by eye.
251. Yea,
pure air was revered
and preserved,
and the breathing of pure air
was an inalienable right
of every citizen.
252. For, indeed,
this was an enlightened civilization.
253. Lo:
In this future,
the people cultivated
both intuition and knowledge,
for it is in the
balance of the two
that we find wisdom.
254. Wherefore,
these people developed
a knowingness
that was wise beyond facts,
being a knowingness
wherein facts danced
hand-in-hand
with their Sister,
Holy Intuition.
255. For,
wisdom
is the balance of
Masculine Knowledge
with Feminine Knowledge.
256. And Masculine Knowledge
is of the
analytical mind,
which deals with
facts and figures.
257. And Feminine Knowledge
is of the
intuitive mind,
which is like unto a third eye,
perceiving things invisible,
and having realizations profound.
258. And each man
and woman
of this blessed future,
did revere
and cultivate
both the Masculine Knowledge
and the Feminine.
259. For, behold:
One without the other
is like unto a bird
with but one wing
that cannot fly.
260. Yea,
the Bird of Wisdom
has both Wings of Knowledge,
the Masculine and the Feminine,
and flies high!
261. Behold:
all important decisions
of this blessed civilization
were made in great wisdom.
262. The councils of the people
reflected deeply
on every decision,
considering the impact
not only on one generation,
but seven.
263. Yea,
and the greatest seers
considered the impact
on seven times seven generations,
and their wise counsel
was greatly prized
by the people.
264. For the greatest seers
were called Prophets,
and the highest council
was the Council of the Prophets.
265. And the Prophets themselves
sought the counsel
of Elohim and Jah-Jah.
266. And in that seeking
was the greatest wisdom
of the Prophets.
267. This blessed civilization
invented not evil things
that destroy
or harm the health.
268. And the things they created
fouled not the air or land,
and the people were
healthy and happy.
269. Yea,
from their minds
came forth
blessed creations,
in harmony
with nature,
harming not the Earthly Mother
or her creatures.
270. For their minds
were enlightened
by the wisdom of YHWH,
and their world
was blessed.
¶ 271. But, behold:
I saw that the present path
of mankind
was not the blessed path
unto the blessed future,
but a tilted path
of knowledge without wisdom.
272. And I was shown
a vision of the future
to which this present path
will lead.
273. Lo:
poisons filled the sky,
and the people choked
on foul air.
274. And the birds,
which had been plentiful,
became scarce,
and false birds ruled the air.
275. For,
every sort of thing
that the mind of man
could possibly conceive,
he built.
276. Yea,
mankind created things
with little or no
concern for the consequences,
the main concern being
the profit for the maker.
277. And the consequences
were often grave,
leading to illness and death,
and the desecration of nature.
278. Behold:
not only nature
was desecrated by mankind,
mankind desecrated also himself.
279. Yea,
false foods and false suns
made way for false bodies.
280. Lo:
Even false brains
were made.
281. At first the false brains
were separate
from the head of man.
186
The Megillah Book of Enoch Chapter 4
282. But then, behold:
Man began,
bit by bit,
to attach his head
to the false brains.
283. And the false brains
were artificial,
being not of nature
but man-made.
284. And the false brains were
intellect without heart,
and knowledge without intuition.
285. Wherefore the reasoning
of the false brains
was flawed,
being out of balance.
286. And those who refused
the false bodies of the Fifth Seal,
and were called The Naturals,
refused also
to connect their minds
to the artificial brains
of the Sixth Seal.
287. Yea,
and they refused
to submit to the Master Brain
of the hidden powers.
288. For, behold:
the hidden powers controlled
an artificial brain
that was the Master Brain
of all the artificial brains.
289. And all the millions
of workers with false brains,
were linked to a Master Brain
at their workplace.
290. And the Master Brain
of each workplace
was linked to
the Master Brain of each city.
291. And the Master Brain
of each city
was linked to
the Master Brain of each nation.
¶ 292. And the Master Brain
of each nation
was linked to the Master Brain
of the Hidden Powers,
which was massive
and buried beneath a mountain
in the land of the Eagle.
293. In the tongue of the Eagle,
the Master Brain was called G.O.D.
[Global Organization Database].
294. Yea,
the Hidden Powers controlled
the Master Brain.
295. And he who controlled
the Hidden Powers,
was Lucifer.
296. Then,
I opened the Seventh Seal,
and was shown a vision
of the dawn of this world.
297. I beheld two angels
in the sky of this new world,
one,
the Angel of YHWH,
the other,
the Angel of Mother Earth.
298. These are the messenger angels
of the Center Branch
and the Center Root
of the Tree of Life.
299. And the Angel of YHWH
gazed upon this new world
with spiritual eyes.
300. And the Angel of Mother Earth
gazed upon this new world
with motherly eyes.
301. Lo:
These two angels
looked into the eyes
of one another,
then embraced.
302. In that embrace,
he knew what she knew,
and she knew what he knew.
303. Yea,
and he felt what she felt,
for he was balanced
187
The Megillah Book of Enoch Chapter 4
in mind and heart.
304. And she felt what he felt,
for she was balanced
in mind and heart.
305. Together,
they made love
in the sky above this world,
then on the land.
306. And this was the dance
of spirit and nature.
307. And the children of Earth
would inherit this dance
within themselves;
for, behold:
This blessing is the gift
of the Angel of YHWH
and the Angel of Mother Earth.
308. And together,
these angels made a plan.
309. And this plan
was due to their awareness
that the Luciferian powers
would attack this world.
310. Yea,
for they had been warned
by the Lord and Lady
that this attack would soon come.
311. For, behold:
They had counseled
with the Lord and Lady,
and with Abraham and Sa’arah,
and with all the angels
of the Tree of Life.
312. Yea,
they were prepared
for the Luciferian attack
that soon would come.
313. Yea,
and their successors
would be prepared;
for,
the Angels of the Tree of Life
hold holy counsels together,
and with the Lord and Lady.
314. Though prepared,
they would intervene only
to preserve The Choice.
315. Yea,
the souls of this new world
would remain free
to choose
between the plans
of Elohim and Lucifer
for this world;
For, such is the way of
The Great Freedom,
in accordance with
The Laws of Intervention.
316. And I beheld
a possible blessed future
wherein mankind made
The Choice to follow Elohim,
and to reject Lucifer.
317. And I knew that
The Great Civilization
that I beheld in my visions
of the first Six Seals,
was but one civilization:
the civilization that will exist
whenever mankind makes
The Choice for Elohim.
318. Yea,
once again,
I beheld The Great Civilization,
this time having opened
the Seventh Seal.
319. I beheld
the dance of the people,
which was
the dance of spirit and nature.
320. Yea,
each child of this world
heard the music of that dance
within their own heart.
321. For, behold:
The dance was within them.
322. And hearing the music
they rose and danced,
ascending the Golden Ladder
step by step.
323. Lo:
Eternal life as spirits
dancing with nature,
188
The Megillah Book of Enoch Chapter 4
is The Great Gift
of Jah-Jah and Elohim
to the children of
The Mother Ovum.
324. And the children of Earth,
in this blessed possible future,
joyfully accepted this gift
and made the most
of this great blessing.
325. Yea,
they lived the gift;
for, truly,
they were spirits
dancing with nature.
326. Lo:
They knew that the body,
made of the elements of nature,
is the temple of the spirit,
and lived accordingly.
327. Yea,
they danced with
the angels of the Earthly Mother,
and also with
the angels of YHWH.
328. For,
they were centered
in the Tree of Life,
which was within them
and all around them.
329. And Earth
was a garden paradise,
and spiritual enlightenment
was a fruit enjoyed by all.
330. But behold:
I saw that the present path
of mankind
was not the blessed path
unto the blessed future,
but a path of both
blessing and cursing.
331. For,
it was not the path
of choosing Elohim,
but neither was it entirely
the path of Lucifer.
332. Lo:
It was a mix of the two,
but tilted toward Lucifer.
333. And this tilting
was due
not only to the
Luciferian attack
at the inception of this world,
when bad seed was
mixed with good,
but also to the choices
of the children of Earth.
334. For many had made
unwise choices
resulting in pain and darkness.
335. And according to
The Great Freedom and
The Laws of Intervention,
Elohim intervened just enough
to preserve The Choice.
336. Lo:
as I beheld the dark future
to which the present path
of mankind will lead,
– for, any path tilted toward
Lucifer leads not to pleasure
but pain –
I saw that the hidden powers
desired to eliminate
The Choice.
337. They who are called
the hidden powers
serve the cause of Lucifer,
some knowingly
and some unknowingly.
338. And,
fearing death,
they sought to make themselves
immortal, artificially.
339. For,
believing the lies of Lucifer,
they believed themselves mortal
and desired immortality.
340. Behold:
The free gift of YHWH
is eternal life as a Spirit.
341. And Mother Nature
provides the body
189
The Megillah Book of Enoch Chapter 4
most fitted
to our thoughts, words, and deeds.
342. But these men
knew not their true nature,
and so conceived a plan
whereby they would make
themselves immortal,
and would rule the world.
343. But the plan they thought
they conceived,
was actually conceived
by Lucifer;
for,
he whispered the words
of the plan
into the heads
of the hidden powers,
who believed his thoughts
to be their own.
344. And I beheld
the unfolding of the
dark plan,
which was now in the time
of the Seventh Seal.
345. I beheld soldiers
of the false powers
searching the wilderness
for Naturals;
for,
those who refused
connection to the Master Brain
and were called Outcasts,
were now declared Outlaws.
346. For,
that connection
to the Master Brain,
which had been optional,
was now required.
347. And because they had
natural bodies,
those once called
The Naturals
were now called
Animals.
348. And they were rounded up
like animals
by the artificials,
by order of the Master Brain.
349. Also persecuted
at the time of the Seventh Seal,
were The Partials.
350. These were those persons
who had only partially
enhanced their bodies,
stopping short of
connecting their brain
with the Master Brain.
351. And the Partials
allied themselves
with the Naturals
in common cause against
the Master Brain
of the hidden powers.
352. Lo:
their alliance was not
of violence,
but of nonviolent resistance.
353. For, behold:
Nasareans of the Zeroah Nistar
were the hidden leaders
of the resistance,
and do not sanction violence.
354. But others who had refused
‘enhancement’
and opposed the Master Brain
and false powers,
practiced not nonviolence.
355. For, behold:
The children of the Crescent Moon
rebelled against the Master Brain
with weapons and terror.
356. Lo:
They struck within
the belly of the beast
and unleashed a cataclysm
like none before.
357. Yea,
a false sun,
the very power by which
the Eagle ruled the world,
was hidden within
the skull of the Eagle.
358. And the head of the Eagle
exploded in a blaze
190
The Megillah Book of Enoch Chapter 5
of poisonous fire,
killing many.
359. And the White Palace,
which was the home
of the King of Eagles,
was turned to black ash.
360. But the Eagle was not dead,
only wounded.
361. Yea, enraged,
the Eagle took to the air,
and from his talons
unleashed the fires of hell
on the nations of
the Crescent Moon.
362. And with the
supposed leaders
of the Eagles
dead and out of the way
– for they governed from
the city of the White Palace
that was turned to ash –
the hidden powers behind
the Master Brain
were free to act.
363. And act they did.
364. For, behold:
The hidden powers
behind the false powers
had long planned
for this day.
365. Yea,
they had painstakingly
prepared the ground
and planted the seeds.
366. Even the seed
of the attack on the Eagle
was of their planting.
367. Safely underground,
in their caves beneath mountains,
these men of
metal mated with flesh,
who were half man,
half machine,
smiled.
368. For, behold:
After this holocaust
would come a
New World Order,
and they would rule
with an iron fist,
as living immortals.
369. For they would
take the next step
in human enhancement,
becoming living light.
370. But behold:
What Lucifer told them
was ‘living light’,
was truly ‘enslaved light’,
and was the
Third Body of Satan.

Adam and Eve
Now, when the Tree of Life was planted
in the center of the Garden, Adam
and Eve were awakened from sleep.
2. Behold, the bodies of Adam and Eve
were not like our flesh; they were of a flesh
that need not die.
3. Lo: their flesh radiated the gleam of
light.
4. And the Garden was beautiful!
5. It was a place of delight!
6. The colors of the soil, plants, flowers,
and sky were vivid and radiant!
7. The scent of the Garden was sweet!
8. And the animals were friendly and
harmed not each other, nor ate each other,
nor did they harm Adam and Eve.
9. Even so, the animals were of mortal
flesh; for animals are souls who have not
yet attained immortal bodies, and mankind
was to be their guide and example.
10. But even the mortal flesh of the animals
gleamed and was of a different nature than
today, being lighter and sparkling with
innocence.
11. And the water was clear and sweet!
12. Yea, and the sounds of the Garden
were joyful and happy!
13. Behold: Adam and Eve played!
14. Yea, and they played fair, neither
disrespecting the other; for, though
they rejoiced in their differences – the
differences being that Adam was male and
Eve female – they knew their differences
to be complementary and a source of great
joy.
15. Yea, they knew that even in their diver-
sity they were essentially a unity, and thus
were equally worthy.
16. And all these things they knew by
intuition, which was the voice of Jah-Jah
within.
17. Then, behold: from the border of Kush
came a voice like thunder.
18. Adam and Eve went down from the
holy Mount in the Garden to see what was
the source of the strange noise.
19. Yea, they walked for many miles, fol-
lowing the voice that boomed like thunder,
until they reached the border of Kush.
20. Lo: at the border of Kush were a multi-
tude of Beings with metal heads and long
staffs of metal.
21. Adorning each staff were two serpents
the color of copper.
22. Yea, the serpents were coiled round
the length of the staff, their heads at the
top.
23. And upon the metal foreheads of the
Beings, yea, and upon their chests in the
area of the heart, was an insignia of wings,
and on the wings was written the number
of their Master, which number is 666.
24. For that is the number that symbolizes
enslaved light.
25. And that is the number on their insig-
nia because Satan desires to prevent
Beings from reaching the level of Perfected
Light, which is 777.
26. And these Beings of 666 are called
Seraphim.
27. And in the center of the multitude of
Seraphim was Lucifer.
28. And Lucifer spoke to Adam and Eve,
saying: “Behold, I am the Lord your God.
29. It is I who created you.
30. Have you yet eaten from the tree at the
top of the mountain that is at the center of
the Garden?”
31. Adam said, “No, my Lord, but that is
what we were going to do when we heard
a voice like thunder from the border of
Kush.”
32. Eve said, “We have come to see what
was the source of that sound.”
33. Lucifer said, “I am the source of that
sound.
34. Yea, it was by my voice that you were
called, even as it was by my hand that you
were made.
35. And I have come just in time to save
you; for, you were about to eat from the
tree in the center of the Garden.
36. And if you eat from that tree you will
surely die.
37. But I will give you another tree to eat
from; and the tree I give you will help you
become like me.”
38. Lucifer, masquerading as Yahweh,
continued to preach to Adam and Eve,
saying: “Behold, my flesh is not like your
flesh; mine is hard and strong, for my
flesh is metal.
39. If you eat from the tree I give you, your
own flesh will become more firm and will
not break so easily.
40. Now your young bodies are so light
that they may easily be broken.
41. And that would grieve me, for I am the
Lord, your God.
42. And I want you to become like me.
43. Yea, I tell you truly, follow my voice
and your flesh will become harder each
generation.
44. “Lo: when you and your descendents
have grown dense enough, I will wed your
bodies of flesh with metal; then your minds
will be connected to my mind and you will
become my kind of light.
45. Then you will easily obey my voice; for,
I will speak directly to your mind and you
will hear no other voice.
46. But now your bodies are too light and
your mind will hear another voice.
47. Hear me!
48. You must not obey any voice but
mine!
49. For it is I who have given you life, and
if you do not obey me, I will take away
your life.
50. For I am the Lord your God!
51. And I am a jealous God!
52. You will have no other God but me!
53. If you and your descendents will follow
my path, one day you will no longer hear
the other voice.
54. Then you will find it easy to obey my
word.
55. But now it will be hard; for, your bodies
are too light and your minds are not yet
wedded to metal.
56. Now your bodies are mortal and you
can die; but if you eat of the tree I give you,
and do not eat of the tree in the center of the
Garden, you will be immortal like me.
57. “Lo: before your flesh can be wedded
to metal, and to things like metal that you
do not know of, your seed must become like
my seed.
58. Behold my staff: see the two snakes
that spiral round each other.
59. This is the symbol of my seed.
60. This symbol will become your symbol.
61. And if you obey my voice, yea, if you
eat from my tree and shun the tree in the
center of the Garden, your seed will become
like my seed.”
62. Adam spoke to Lucifer, asking: “My
Lord, since you are our Father, why are we
not already of your seed?
63. And why, when you created the
Garden, did you put the bad tree in the
center of the Garden?”
64. Lucifer grew angry and shouted with
a voice like thunder, “How dare you
question the Lord your God!
65. Your place is to obey my words, not to
question my words.
66. When your body becomes hard enough,
you shall feel the rod of my chastisement
upon your skin, which is the rod of my
justice, which is for your salvation.
67. But now I cannot save you with my
rod, for your body is too light to feel the
fire of my correction.
68. We must first harden your skin; yea,
you must become more dense.
69. “But, behold: I am also a merciful
God.
70. And the questions you asked, I will
answer.
71. Behold, the tree in the center of the
Garden was created by an evil one.
72. Yea, with the planting of that tree the
entire Garden was ruined!
73. Even your seed was damaged!
74. For the evil one who planted the seed
of the tree in the center of the Garden
caused your body to be light like His.
75. Beware of His symbol!
76. For His staff is His symbol; and that
staff is not strong metal like mine, but is
wood, which is weak and can break.
77. But my staff is metal and breaks only
the backs and wills of those it corrects.
78. For I am a mighty God but He is
weak.
79. And whereas the symbol upon my
staff, which is the symbol of my seed, is
the double spiral of serpents, His is the
double spiral of vines with flowers.
80. And atop my staff are two serpent heads,
but atop His staff is a sun with two
wings.
81. Beware the symbol of His seed!
82. Turn away from those who carry that
staff!
83. Now, no more questions!
84. I am the Lord your God!
85. Obey my voice and shun the other
voice.”
86. Lucifer again spoke to Adam and Eve,
saying, “If I am to save you, you must do
what I say.
87. I will now teach you many things.
88. The evil one has trapped you in this
Garden.
89. I have prepared a cave for you outside
the Garden, but you cannot yet step across
the border of the Garden because you are
too light.
90. Yea, before you can step across this
border you must become more dense.
91. And I cannot enter the Garden because
my body is strong; yea, only the weak may
enter the Garden.
92. But I will reveal to you the way to
become strong of body, that you may
escape the Garden.
93. You must eat the flesh of animals.
94. But now you cannot eat their flesh
because you are not dense enough.
95. Therefore you must grow more dense,
which can be accomplished by killing
creatures.
96. After you have slain animals, you will
grow dense enough to eat their flesh.
97. And when you eat their flesh, you will
grow even more dense and will be able to
leave the Garden.
98. “Lo, once you eat flesh, I will be able
to enter your body and speak from within
you.
99. Now I am able only to speak to you
from outside of you.
100. Also, know this: I have created you
so that I can take pleasure with you.
101. When I enter you I will be able to enjoy
whatever you enjoy; for, your senses will
become my senses.¹
102. “Therefore, go now into the Garden
and find a lamb.
103. And slay that lamb.
104. And pour the blood of the lamb upon
your hands.
105. Make a spear from a branch, in the
manner that I teach you.
106. But the branch you use to kill the
lamb must be taken from the Tree of Life.
107. For, by such a deed you will break
your allegiance to that tree and declare
your allegiance to me.
108. Yea, by that act you will prove you
are my children and will become strong
and dense like me.
109. But be warned: When you go to take a
branch from that tree, eat not of its fruit!
110. If you do, your body will become so
light you will surely die!”
111. After Lucifer instructed Adam and
Eve in the art of making spears, he sent
them into the Garden to kill a lamb.
112. Lucifer said, “When you kill the lamb,
bring its body to me as an offering.
113. I will then make you initiates of my
temple.
114. Yea, I will instruct you in the rituals
of the Temple of the Serpent.”
115. Adam and Eve walked into the midst
of the Garden.
116. Adam said to Eve, “I do not want
to kill a lamb but we must obey the Lord
God.”
117. Eve said, “It feels wrong within me,
but he is the Lord our God.”
118. Adam and Eve climbed the mountain
in the center of the Garden and found the
Tree of Life.
119. But before Adam broke a branch to
make a spear, Eve said, “Behold, the time
has come for me to birth our first child.
120. Yea, even now the baby wants out!”
121. Indeed, Eve was pregnant and
about to give birth.
122. For, in the time of play in the Garden
before they had gone to hear the voice like
thunder, Adam and Eve had made love as
they lay beneath the branches of the Tree
of Life.
123. And in this time before humankind
had dense bodies, the time between
conception and birth was brief.
124. Adam said, “We will make a spear and
kill a lamb after our baby is born.”
125. Eve pointed to a spot beneath the
branches of the Tree of Life and said,
“There is where we made love and made
this baby.
126. I feel that I should birth the baby
there.”
127. Lo: Beneath the branches of the Tree
of Life, Eve gave birth to her first child.
128. Adam said, “Behold, we are blessed
with a son!”
129. Adam and Eve named the boy Abdiel,²
which means Servant of Elohim.
130. And the reason they chose that name
is as follows.
131. While Eve had given birth, perched
upon the top center branch of the Tree of
Life was a white Dove, singing.
132. Yea, the Dove sweetly sang the name
Abdiel while Eve gave birth to the baby
boy.
133. Within her, Eve felt that this was a
fitting name for her son.
134. Adam also heard the song of the Dove
and knew this to be the true name of his
son.
135. Behold: Eve put the baby to her
breast and Abdiel drank her milk and was
nourished.
136. Then the family slept together beneath
the branches of the Tree of Life.
137. The white Dove sang while they
slept.
138. The next morning when they awoke,
Adam said to Eve, “We must break off a
branch from this tree and make a spear.
139. We must obey the command of the
Lord our God.
140. We must slay a lamb.”
141. Eve said, “A voice within warns me
not to do this thing.”
142. Adam said, “I, too, hear that voice,
but we must not listen.
143. The Lord our God told us to ignore
that voice.
144. We must obey the Lord.”
145. Eve made a bed of leaves for Abdiel
beneath the tree.
146. She placed him upon the bed to sleep
and said to Adam, “I will help you break
off a branch.”
147. Adam and Eve tried to break off a
branch from the Tree of Life but they could
not.
148. “This tree is too strong!” said Adam.
149. “Let us make a spear from another
tree”, said Eve.
150. And so it was that Adam and Eve
broke off a branch of another tree and
made a spear.
151. Adam said, “We now have a spear.
152. Let us hunt for a lamb to kill.”
153. When they had found a lamb and
were about to slay it with the spear,
behold, another Lamb came forth and
spoke, saying: “Spare that lamb; spear
Me, instead.”
154. Adam and Eve both took hold of
the spear; together, they drove the spear
through the body of the Lamb.
155. As the Lamb bled to death, Adam
asked: “Why did you offer yourself in
place of the other lamb?”
156. The Lamb said, “I forgive you, for you
know not what you do.
157. Because I forgive you, the consequenc-
es of this act will not be as great as if I did
not forgive you.
158. The other lamb may not have forgiven
you and then the consequences would
have been far greater.
159. The consequences are still great; but
this way you will have a second chance.
160. And when My blood is spilled upon
the Tree of Life, it will be as the Water of
Life; and that will defeat the plan of
Lucifer.”
161. The Lamb died, and Adam and
Eve understood not the meaning of His
words.
162. Then, as Lucifer had instructed,
Adam and Eve poured the blood of the
Lamb upon their hands.
163. Adam said, “My mind is in torment!
164. I am in anguish!”
165. Eve said, “I feel terrible!
166. I am sad and miserable!”
167. Adam said, “Let us take the body of
the Lamb to the Lord our God.
168. Perhaps he can make us feel better!”
169. Adam and Eve left Abdiel in his bed
of leaves; for, he was asleep and they did
not wish to disturb him.
170. They climbed down the mountain
and found Lucifer waiting for them at the
border of Kush.
171. Lucifer was pleased when he saw the
slain Lamb.
172. He said, “Behold: I am Yahweh, the
Lord God.
173. I am pleased with your offering!
174. Did you slay the Lamb with a spear
made from the tree in the center of the
Garden?”
175. Adam said, “That tree was too
strong.
176. We could not break off a branch.
177. We used a branch from another tree
to make the spear.”
178. Lucifer, masquerading as Yahweh,
was enraged.
179. With a voice like thunder he shouted,
“How dare you disobey a commandment
of the Lord your God!
180. I would let you feel the rod of my
chastisement upon your back but you still
are not dense enough to feel its fire.
181. But, lo: You are denser now than when
I last saw you.”
182. Adam said, “Lord, ever since we
killed the Lamb, Eve and I have felt great
anguish!
183. We feel terrible!
184. Can you help us feel better?”
185. Lucifer smiled, then spoke: “You feel
inner torment because you did not fully
carry out my command.
186. Also, this was your first kill and you
are not yet used to it.
187. Once you have become used to it, it
will become a great joy!
188. Lo: it is great play!
189. Yea, it is called hunting!
190. And I am the spiritual father of all
hunters!
191. And you are greatly blessed; for of
all the creatures in the Garden, you have
become the first hunters.
192. Yea, the first blood is on your
hands!³
193. “And I will heal you of your inner
torment.
194. Behold: I will teach you to take great
pleasure in hunting!
195. Your heart will beat fast in anticipa-
tion of the kill!
196. You will take delight in sneaking
up slowly behind your victim, or hiding
behind a bush in ambush!
197. And your mouth will salivate in
anticipation of the taste of your victim’s
lesh!
198. But before you can eat the flesh of this
Lamb, you need become a bit more dense.
199. And that will be accomplished by
more killing, which also will heal your inner
torment.”
200. Lucifer instructed Adam and Eve to
make more spears.
201. He then pointed to some deer eating
grass in a meadow and said, “Behold: a
mother deer and her fawn.
202. Kill the fawn first, then the mother.
203. But before you kill the mother, make
certain that she sees the death of her
fawn.”
204. Adam and Eve killed the deer, first the
fawn then the mother.
205. Then they killed other animals
according to the will of Lucifer.
206. At first the killing was hard; but then
it became easier; and by the end of the
day, Adam declared: “Hunting is fun!
207. It makes me feel powerful”.
208. But Eve said, “I do not like it.
209. It feels wrong within me.”
210. Lucifer, hearing the words of Adam
and Eve, declared: “Adam, you are stronger
than Eve because I made you in my own
image and likeness.
211. Eve is weaker because I made her
from one of your ribs.
212. I made her to be your servant.
213. Yea, she is not your equal.
214. Because you are stronger, you must
rule over her.
215. Her purpose in life is to serve me by
serving you.
216. She must serve you as though you
were me, the Lord God, and you must
serve me.
217. If you serve me, you will be a good
example for her.4
218. Yea, and a good example for the
children you will make with Eve.
219. Behold: you need her to make
children that can be raised to do my will.
220. Now, cut into pieces the doe, and
taste your first flesh!
221. After you have both eaten you will
make a baby that will be dedicated unto
me, the Lord God.
222. For I am Yahweh.”
223. Adam ate the flesh, and blood ran
down his cheek.
224. Because of the killing, his body was
now dense enough to eat flesh.
225. Eve also ate the flesh.
226. Though she had not felt right about
the killing, she had obeyed the voice of
Lucifer and killed many creatures.
227. Yea, blood was also on her hands and
her body had become dense enough to eat
flesh, though not as dense as Adam’s; for,
Adam had enjoyed the killing, but Eve had
not.
228. But with the eating of flesh, Eve’s body
became as dense as Adam’s.
229. And so it was that Adam and Eve put
on the bodies of animals.
230. After Adam and Eve ate, Lucifer said,
“Now I will teach you how to make a
baby.”
231. Adam said, “We know how.
232. We have already made one baby
boy.”
233. Lucifer was angry, for he had not
known that Adam and Eve had made a
baby under the branches of the Tree of
Life.
234. This was not according to the plan of
Lucifer.
235. Lo: Lucifer had desired to taint the
seed of humankind from the beginning.
236. Lucifer raised his serpent staff and,
behold: enslaved light came from it and
stung the flesh of Adam and Eve.
237. Lucifer shouted, “Now you can feel
the fire of my wrath upon your backs!”
238. Adam and Eve fell to the ground in
pain.
239. Lucifer said, “Where is the baby you
made before you killed animals and tasted
flesh?”
240. Adam said, “We left the baby beneath
the tree atop the mountain in the center of
the Garden.”
241. Lucifer said, “You must bring the baby
to me.
242. It is an abomination and must die.
243. Because your bodies are not yet hard
metal like mine, you may still be able to
get near the center of the Garden.
244. And when you get as near as you can
to the center, call to your child.
245. Yea, bid the child come to you.
246. Then grab the child and bring him to
me.
247. Lo: take with you the body of the first
creature you killed, the Lamb.
248. When you grab your child, pour some
of the blood of the Lamb upon his hands.
249. He will then be easier to control.
250. And then pour some of the blood
around the tree in the center of the
Garden.
251. “But before you go, behold: make a
baby for me; do this now, beneath the
branches of my tree.
252. Yea, now that you have tasted flesh
you may step across the border of the
Garden and take pleasure beneath the
branches of my tree.
253. And when you return with your child,
you will sacrifice him to me beneath the
branches of my tree.
254. And then you will enter the cave
I have prepared for you; it will be your
home.”
255. Then Lucifer whispered in the ear of
Adam how he was to take Eve and make
her pregnant: “Hold her down and take
her; you are stronger than her and need
not ask permission.
256. If you force her rather than ask her,
the baby you make will be stronger.”
257. So it was that Adam took Eve by the
hair and pulled her to him.
258. He then held her down and entered
her, asking not for permission and listening
not to her words.
259. And this was very different from
when Adam and Eve had made love in the
center of the Garden.
260. And the soul that was attracted was
very different from that of Abdiel.
261. Yea, the soul that incarnated in the
womb of Eve was very dark, indeed.
262. Lo: the floodgates were now open.
263. With the killing of animals and the
rape of Eve, many dark souls were attracted
to this world, and this was not according
to the plan of Abraham and Sa’arah.
264. Some of these dark souls came to
incarnate so that they could kill and eat
flesh.
265. Others came to hover disembodied,
feeding on emotional pain like parasites.
266. But Abraham and Sa’arah sent other
souls to incarnate in this world, some who
were young but not dark, which were those
this world was meant for, and some very
bright souls, to be helpers and teachers. 5
267. After Adam had taken Eve in the
manner Lucifer had instructed, Lucifer

said: “Now that Eve is made pregnant,
I shall put her egg in this gourd of glass.
268. For I do not want this egg going near
the center of the Garden.”
269. Then Lucifer reached into the womb
of Eve with a metal stick and got her egg.
270. Yea, he then placed it in a gourd made
of glass.
271. Lucifer said, “Go and do as I have
commanded; for, I am the Lord your God
and you must obey me.
272. Lo: I am a jealous and vengeful
God!
273. Fear me and do my will!
274. I am Yahweh!”
275. Now, when Adam and Eve had
begun killing animals in the Garden, the
atmosphere of the Garden was changed.
276. The murderous deeds had released
noxious fumes that could not be seen but
could be felt. 6
277. Whereas there had been no fear in
the Garden, now fear spread throughout
the Garden.
278. Yea, some animals began to kill and
eat other animals, and those that did not
kill began to fear those that did kill.
279. And the atmosphere was now much
more dense; thus, all the bodies of animals
and plants had become more dense in
order to adapt.
280. Lo: this made it possible for Adam and
Eve to get near the center of the Garden.
281. But they could no longer enter the
center.
282. Behold: when they could get no closer
to the center, Adam and Eve were tired.
283. Adam said, “Let us sleep.
284. In the morning we will call Abdiel to
us.”
285. Adam put the dead body of the Lamb
beneath his head to serve as a pillow.
286. That night, Adam dreamed many
dreams: He saw the animals he had killed;
they crowded around a throne and upon
the throne was a Lamb.
287. And the animals were angry, and
petitioned the Lamb for justice.
288. And as Adam looked into the eyes of
each animal, he saw in their eyes the fear
and hatred he had caused.
289. Lo: as each animal testified before
the Lamb on the throne, Adam was forced
to watch his killing of that animal; lo, he
felt the unspeakable terror that each of his
victims had felt.
290. And after all the animals had testified,
the Lamb on the throne pointed to the hole
in His chest, which was from the spear of
Adam and Eve, for this was the first creature
that had been slain by Adam and Eve.
291. Yea, this was the Lamb that had
offered itself in place of another lamb,
and even now served as the pillow
beneath the head of the sleeping Adam.
292. Then the Lamb on the throne began
to speak, but Adam pulled away from his
dream in fear and trembling.
293. Lo: Adam awoke in a sweat, his belly
in great pain from the flesh he had eaten.
294. A part of him had desired to listen to the
voice of the Lamb, but his guilty conscience
was afraid.
295. He called for Eve, but Eve was no
longer by his side.

Recognitions of Clement. For more information on the content of those texts, see Expanded Footnote
Seven: The Ebionite Clementine Texts, at the back of this book.

² In this Nasarean Bible, the first two children of Adam and Eve are named Abdiel and Cain. In the
Orthodox Bible, their first two children are named Abel and Cain. Let us look at the meanings of those
names. Abdiel, a Hebrew name, means Servant of Elohim. That is the name used in this Nasarean
Bible. The name used in the Orthodox Bible, Abel, sounds similar to Abdiel but is a different word with
different meaning: Abel, in Hebrew is Hebel and literally means Morning Mist. By implication Hebel
also means Worthlessness, Emptiness and Vanity, those negative meanings coming from the sense of
Mist as being Insubstantial. The name Cain in Hebrew is Qayin and means Spear. Because spearheads
are often made of metal, the word Qayin also means Spearmaker, Spearhead, Metal, and Metal Worker.
The story of Abdiel and Cain in the Nasarean Bible is fundamentally different than the story of Abel
and Cain in the Orthodox Bible.

³ This theme of the first killing of an animal by humankind and the sort of consequences that follow
is well described by Upton Ewing in his book, The Essene Christ. For a long excerpt from that book see
Expanded Footnote Eight: Excerpt on the Fall of Man from The Essene Christ.

4 This same theology in regard to the relationship of woman to man was preached by the Apostle
Paul in the Orthodox New Testament, almost word for word. For a comparison and contrast of
Nasarean teachings with the teachings of Paul, see Expanded Footnote Nine: Nasarean Christianity
or Paulianity?

5 Even in the Orthodox New Testament there is a reference to this mixing of good seed and bad
seed. In Matthew 13:24-31, Jesus said: “The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man who sowed good
seed in his field: But… his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went his way. But when
the wheat was sprung up… then appeared the weeds also. So the servants of the man said… ‘Do you
want us to go and pull out the weeds?’ But the man said, ‘No, because you might also uproot the wheat
before its time. Let both grow together until the harvest . . . .”
