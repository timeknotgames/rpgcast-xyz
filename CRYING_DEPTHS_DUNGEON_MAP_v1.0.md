### ROOM KEY — LEVEL 1

**[1] ROOTFALL GATEWAY**
*The entrance is not built — it is grown. Massive dead roots form an archway, calcified and gray, dripping with phosphorescent condensation. The air smells of wet stone and old grief.*

- **Perception Check (D6 Earth/Smell):** Attainment 40%+ detects a chemical sweetness beneath the decay — dream-mucus. Something alive is rotting below.
- **Hazard:** The roots shift occasionally. Any sound louder than a whisper has a 1-in-D8 chance of causing a minor collapse (D4 Fire/Agility check to dodge, 1 Endurance damage on failure).
- **Lore:** This is the dead star's rootfall — the remains of a celestial tree that fell here ages ago. The Night Hags built their facility beneath its corpse, drawing residual astral energy from the dead roots.

**[2] FUNGAL GALLERY**
*A vast cavern of bioluminescent fungal towers, each 10-20 feet tall, pulsing with sickly blue-green light. The towers are veined with dream-mucus — thick, translucent strands that connect them like a neural network.*

- **Encounter:** 2D6 **Spore Drifters** — mindless fungal constructs that patrol the gallery. They do not attack unless the dream-mucus network is disturbed. Attainment: D8 Air 30%.
- **Secret:** If a character touches a fungal tower and succeeds on a D10 Mind/Willpower check (Attainment 50%+), they receive a flash-vision: the Facility's layout from the fungus network's perspective. Grants advantage on navigation for the rest of Level 1.
- **Hazard:** Dream-mucus contact. Skin contact forces a D12 Ether/Creativity save (Attainment 40%+) or the character hallucinates for 1D4 rounds, seeing the cavern as it was before the hags — beautiful, alive, full of singing crystals.

**[3] SPORE GROTTO**
*A smaller cave branching off the gallery. The air is thick with floating spores that glow faintly gold. The ground is carpeted with soft, spongy growth.*

- **Rest Point:** Characters who rest here for 10 minutes regain 1 point of Endurance (D6 Earth). The spores are therapeutic — remnants of the original ecosystem before corruption.
- **Treasure:** Buried beneath the spongy floor: a **Dreamcatcher Pendant** (absorbs one fear or nightmare effect per session). D8 Air/Touch check to find it (Attainment 50%+).
- **Warning:** Resting longer than 30 minutes triggers drowsiness. D10 Mind save (Attainment 60%+) or fall into light sleep. Sleeping characters dream of the Facility's victims — not harmful, but deeply unsettling.

**[4] WEEPING ALCOVE**
*A natural hollow in the rock wall. Water seeps down the stone in thin rivulets. The sound is not water — it is weeping. The stone itself is crying.*

- **Lore Discovery:** The walls contain embedded **soulstone fragments** — incomplete, cracked, leaking the emotions of their trapped subjects. A D12 Ether/Sound check (Attainment 40%+) allows a character to hear fragments of words: names, pleas, lullabies in broken tongues.
- **Key Item:** One intact **Unmarked Soulstone** can be pried from the wall (D8 Strength check, Attainment 30%+). This is evidence of the Syndicate's operations — the same kind found by Joseph's border scouts.
- **Emotional Hazard:** Spending more than 5 minutes here without protection forces a D20 Water/Empathy check (Attainment 50%+) or the character begins crying uncontrollably for 1D6 rounds. Not dangerous, but loud — alerts guards in Room 7/8.

**[5] THE LULLABY CORRIDOR**
*A long, curving passage where the acoustics amplify every sound. Echoes of lullabies in broken tongues drift through the air — not from any visible source, but from the walls themselves. The melodies are heartbreaking and slightly wrong, like nursery rhymes with the words replaced.*

- **Ongoing Effect:** All D10 Mind/Willpower checks in this corridor are at -10% Attainment. The lullabies are designed to soften resistance.
- **Counter:** Any character who plays a real instrument or sings a genuine song (D12 Ether/Sound check, any Attainment) cancels the effect for the entire party for the duration of the corridor.
- **Narrative Beat:** This is the players' first encounter with the Facility's psychological architecture. The lullabies are JaiRuviel's Eidolons, transmitted through the stone. The party is already inside his dream field.

**[6] CRECHE OF THE HALF-FORMED**
*Rows of organic pods, each containing a half-formed gremlin — stunted, crying, not fully developed. Some twitch. Some reach out with tiny hands. The pods pulse with dream-mucus, feeding the creatures a cocktail of fear and sadness to keep them in perpetual pre-transformation.*

- **Moral Choice:** The party can attempt to free the half-formed creatures.
  - **Free them:** D20 Water/Empathy check (Attainment 60%+). Success releases 1D4 proto-gremlins who are confused but grateful. They flee into the tunnels. Failure triggers a chain reaction — all pods burst, releasing 3D6 panicked, hostile gremlins.
  - **Leave them:** No mechanical consequence, but characters with high Water composition may feel a Karma impact (GM discretion).
  - **Destroy the pods:** Prevents gremlin reinforcements later but costs 1 Karma point per character.
- **Treasure:** Behind the creche: a Hag Technician's journal documenting gremlin transformation rates, feeding schedules, and references to "the Dreamshard in the Heart."

**[7] & [8] GUARD POSTS LEFT AND RIGHT**
*Two reinforced alcoves flanking the descent shaft. Each contains a soulstone-powered alarm system and a Nightmare Sentry — a semi-corporeal dream construct shaped like a child's worst fear, different for each viewer.*

- **Encounter:** 2 **Nightmare Sentries** (one per post). Each Sentry appears as something personal to the viewer.
  - Attack: D10 Mind assault. Target must beat Attainment 50% on D10 Willpower or become frightened (disadvantage on all rolls for 1D4 rounds).
  - Defense: Immune to physical attacks. Can only be harmed by D12 Ether/Sound or D20 Water/Empathy actions.
  - HP: 3 hits from valid sources.
- **Alarm:** If either Sentry is not neutralized within 3 rounds, the soulstone alarm activates, alerting Level 2.
- **Stealth Option:** D4 Fire/Agility (Attainment 70%+) to slip past both posts without engaging. Only one attempt per character.

**[9] DESCENT SHAFT**
*A vertical shaft, 60 feet deep, lined with calcified root-tendrils that serve as handholds. The air grows warmer and wetter as you descend. The lullabies grow louder. At the bottom: a faint blue glow and the sound of rain that never stops.*

- **Climb:** D8 Air/Strength check (Attainment 40%+) per 20-foot section. Failure = slide 10 feet, take 1 Endurance damage.
- **Transition:** At the bottom, the root-lined stone gives way to smooth, worked surfaces — bio-magitech corridors that hum with stolen energy. You have entered the Facility.

### ROOM KEY — LEVEL 2

**[10] PROCESSING ANTECHAMBER**
*A clinical space. Smooth walls of fused stone and chitin. Bio-magitech conduits run along the ceiling, carrying pulses of blue light — dream energy flowing toward the Heart. The air tastes of salt and electricity.*

- **Information:** Hag-script labels on the walls direct traffic: "MULTIPLICATION →" (to Rain Chambers), "ENCODING →" (to Hexcode Mill), "PRODUCT ←" (from Soulstone Treasury).
- **Encounter:** 1 **Facility Overseer** — a lesser night hag in technician's garb. Not a combat threat. If captured, she reveals the Facility's layout in exchange for her life. If released, she flees and does not return. If harmed, she screams, alerting Rooms 11 and 12.

**[11] & [12] RAIN CHAMBERS ALPHA AND BETA**
*Enormous cylindrical rooms, 40 feet across, where artificial rain falls continuously from ceiling-mounted dream-condensers. Inside each chamber: dozens of mogwai — small, furry, with enormous sad eyes — huddled together under the endless downpour, multiplying in agony. The water is warm and slightly viscous. It smells of tears.*

- **The Horror:** Each chamber holds 30-50 mogwai. They are not hostile — they are livestock. They look up at the party with eyes that have forgotten what "rescue" means.
- **Moral Choice:**
  - **Turn off the rain:** D4 Fire/Agility check (Attainment 50%+) to find and disable the condensers. Stops multiplication but the mogwai are confused and frightened. They may scatter into the facility.
  - **Comfort the mogwai:** D20 Water/Empathy check (Attainment 40%+). Success calms 1D10 mogwai who will follow the party quietly. Failure: the mogwai mistake kindness for another trick and hide.
  - **Proceed without interfering:** The mogwai remain in the rain. They will be relevant in Act V.
- **Hidden Detail:** In Chamber Beta, one mogwai is different — slightly larger, with faintly iridescent fur. This is a proto-Dream Dragon, further along in development than the others. It watches the party with unmistakable intelligence.

**[13] THE HEXCODE MILL**
*The industrial heart of Level 2. A massive room dominated by a churning machine of bone, crystal, and nightmare-metal. Tubes feed into it from the Rain Chambers above, carrying a concentrated distillate of mogwai tears. The machine processes this into soulstone hexcode — raw dream data etched into crystal matrices.*

*The sound is unbearable: a low, throbbing hum punctuated by the echo of thousands of individual sobs, compressed and encoded.*

- **The Machine:** Cannot be destroyed by conventional means — it is warded by the Coven of Seven's collective magic. But it can be sabotaged:
  - **D12 Ether/Sound:** Attainment 60%+. A character can disrupt the encoding frequency by singing or playing a counter-melody. Reduces output by 50% and causes visible distress in the machine (it "flinches").
  - **D10 Mind/Willpower:** Attainment 70%+. A character can attempt to mentally override the machine's programming. Success reveals a vision of the machine's "memory" — the first mogwai it ever processed. The machine remembers.
- **Lore:** The hexcode inscriptions on the soulstones match those found by Joseph's border scouts. This is the source.
- **Hazard:** Prolonged exposure (more than 10 minutes) to the Mill's sound forces D6 Earth/Endurance checks (Attainment 50%+) each round or lose 1 Endurance from psychic erosion.

**[14] FEEDING STATION**
*Racks of enchanted food — midnight bread, cursed confections, poisoned delicacies — designed to trigger gremlin transformations when fed to mogwai after midnight. The food looks delicious but radiates wrongness.*

- **Trap:** Any character who eats the food must make a D10 Mind check (Attainment 80%+) or become aggressive and confused for 2D6 rounds — a taste of what the mogwai experience.
- **Treasure:** Among the racks: a **Recipe of Reversal** — a hag document describing how to un-curse midnight food. Useful for healing transformed gremlins later in the campaign.
- **Tactical Note:** The food can be weaponized. Throwing midnight bread into a group of enemies has unpredictable effects (GM determines based on narrative).

**[15] SOULSTONE TREASURY**
*A vault. Floor to ceiling: shelves of processed soulstones, each glowing faintly with trapped dream-light. Thousands of them. Each one a stolen consciousness. Each one inscribed with hexcode that names no name — only a production number.*

- **The Weight:** Any character entering this room must make a D20 Water/Empathy check (Attainment 30%+). Failure: the character is overwhelmed with grief — disadvantage on all rolls for 1D4 rounds but gains 1 temporary Karma point from the experience of witnessing.
- **Treasure:** Each soulstone is valuable on the black market but carrying them is a moral burden. The party can:
  - **Collect them** for later return to rightful owners (the Road to Redemption's ultimate mission)
  - **Destroy them** — releases the trapped consciousness but the fragments may not find their way home
  - **Leave them** — they remain as evidence and as future rescue targets
- **Secret:** One shelf, in the back, contains **Named Soulstones** — these have personal inscriptions. They belong to the children Joseph's scouts found wandering. Returning these to the children will restore their dreaming.

**[16] HAG QUARTERS**
*Living quarters for the Coven of Seven. Each space is personal and disturbing: walls decorated with pressed dream-flowers (flowers that only exist in nightmares), furniture made of solidified sorrow, mirrors that show the viewer's greatest fear instead of their reflection.*

- **Encounter:** If the alarm was triggered in Room 7/8, 2 members of the Coven of Seven are here, preparing defenses. Otherwise, the quarters are empty.
  - **Coven Hags:** Attack with nightmare magic (D10 Mind assault, Attainment 60% to resist). HP: 5 each. Vulnerable to D12 Ether/Sound and D4 Fire/Sight.
- **Lore:** Journals, correspondence, and production reports reveal the full scope of the Syndicate. One letter references "The Father" (the Ancient Hag King) with fearful reverence: *"He says we move too fast. He says the old ways were better. He does not stop us, but he watches."*
- **Treasure:** A **Dreamshadow Cloak** (grants concealment in dim light, +20% to D4 Agility in darkness). A **Map of Dream Trade Routes** showing soulstone distribution networks across multiple kingdoms.

**[17] THE SLEEP-WALKER'S THRESHOLD**
*A long corridor that shimmers. The air becomes thick, dreamlike. Colors bleed. Sounds delay. The party realizes they are no longer entirely in the material world — they are entering JaiRuviel's dream field.*

- **Effect:** All characters in this corridor are partially in the Dimension of Dreams. Physical actions work at -20% Attainment. Mental and emotional actions work at +20% Attainment.
- **Vision:** Each character sees a brief personal vision — a memory they've suppressed, a fear they haven't faced. No mechanical effect, but sets the tone for Level 3.
- **The Sleep-Walker:** At the far end of the corridor, a shimmering figure stands with arms open and eyes closed — not JaiRuviel himself, but an **Eidolon projection**. It does not attack. It simply watches. If the party approaches peacefully, it steps aside. If the party attacks, it retaliates with a D12 Sound blast (Attainment 60%+ to resist, 2 Endurance damage) and then dissolves.

**[18] INNER GATE**
*A door of crystallized dream-mucus. It is warm to the touch. It breathes. Through it, the blue glow intensifies. The lullabies are no longer echoes — they are right there, on the other side, and they are beautiful and terrible.*

- **Opening:** The gate opens to:
  - A genuine display of empathy (D20 Water check, any Attainment)
  - Physical force (D8 Strength check, Attainment 80%+)
  - The Named Soulstones from Room 15 (touching the gate with a Named Soulstone causes it to weep and open)

### ROOM KEY — LEVEL 3

**[19] EIDOLON CHORUS HALL**
*A cathedral-sized chamber where a dozen Eidolons float in slow orbit, singing. Their forms are translucent, shifting — part dragon, part weeping child, part starlight. The song is the most beautiful and most terrible thing anyone in the party has ever heard. It is a lullaby of despair — a song designed to keep the dreaming compliant.*

- **The Chorus:** The Eidolons are JaiRuviel's — summoned and sustained by his captive dreaming. They are not evil. They are enslaved, just as he is. Their song is his compassion, twisted into a weapon.
- **Effect:** Every round in this room: D10 Mind/Willpower check (Attainment 50%+) or become drowsy (-10% to all physical Attainment). Three failures = fall asleep (entering the dream battlefield of Act III).
- **Counter:** A character who sings WITH the Eidolons (D12 Ether/Sound, Attainment 40%+) can harmonize — transforming the lullaby from despair to something gentler. This does not stop the drowsiness but changes the quality of sleep: characters who fall asleep here dream peacefully instead of facing nightmares.
- **Critical Path:** The party must pass through this hall to reach the Dream Cage. There is no way around the song.

**[20] & [22] MOGWAI NURSERIES WEST AND EAST**
*Side chambers where the youngest mogwai are kept — newborns from the Rain Chambers, too young for tear harvesting but already conditioned to the lullabies. They sleep in clusters of 5-10, piled together for warmth, their tiny bodies rising and falling with synchronized breathing.*

- **No Encounter.** The mogwai are asleep and will not wake unless the Dream Cage is disrupted.
- **Emotional Weight:** These rooms exist to remind the players what is at stake. Each mogwai is a potential Dream Dragon. Each one carries the seed of the Three Tones.
- **Tactical Note:** In Act V (the Mogwai Rebellion), these nurseries empty as the children awaken and transform. Until then, they are silent witnesses.

**[21] THE DREAM CAGE**
*The heart of the Facility. A sphere of crystallized dream-energy, 20 feet in diameter, hovering 10 feet above the floor. Inside: JaiRuviel Stardust, floating in gentle sleep. His skin shifts between black, green, and purple. His silver-black hair drifts like seaweed. His wings fold and unfold slowly, refracting light into labradorescent fire.*

*Around the cage: dozens of half-Dream Dragon mogwai flutter, softly sobbing. Their tears flow down the cage's surface, collecting in grooves that channel into the Hexcode Mill's feed tubes.*

*He is beautiful. He is a machine of sorrow. His kindness is the thing that makes all of this work.*

- **THE BOSS ENCOUNTER — ACT III:**
  When the party approaches the Dream Cage, JaiRuviel's eyes remain closed but his body shifts. The Eidolons converge. A **defensive field** erupts — radiant sleeping flame.

  **JaiRuviel (Sleep-Walker Mode):**
  - Does not attack directly. Generates Eidolon defenders and dream-effects.
  - Each round: one party member must make D10 Mind check (Attainment 60%+) or fall into **personal nightmare** (removed from combat, faces their deepest sin in a dream vision).
  - Eidolon Defenders (4): D12 Sound attack, Attainment 50%+ to resist. HP: 2 each. Re-summon after 2 rounds if destroyed.
  - The Dream Cage itself: immune to physical damage. Can only be disrupted by:
    - **Empathy:** D20 Water (Attainment 70%+) — speaking to JaiRuviel through the cage, reaching the person beneath the programming.
    - **Sound:** D12 Ether (Attainment 80%+) — playing music that is NOT a lullaby. Something joyful. Something free.
    - **Willpower:** D10 Mind (Attainment 90%+) — a direct psychic contest with JaiRuviel's conditioned reflexes. Extremely difficult but possible.

  **Resolution:** When the Dream Cage is disrupted, ALL party members fall asleep simultaneously. The Dream Splice begins.

**[23] THE DREAM SPLICE (DIMENSIONAL OVERLAY)**
*This room does not physically exist. It is a dimensional overlay that manifests when the Dream Cage is disrupted. All characters experience it simultaneously but privately — each facing their own vision.*

- **ACT IV — THE RECKONING:**
  Each character faces their **younger self** — the version of themselves that committed their worst act, made their cruelest choice, or failed when it mattered most.

  **Mechanic:** Each player describes their character's greatest shame. Then:
  - D20 Water/Empathy check (Attainment 60%+): **Face it.** The character weeps, breaks down, and forgives themselves. They wake with +10% to all Attainment for the rest of the session and +1 permanent Karma.
  - Failure: The character cannot face it. They wake shaken — -10% to all Attainment for 1D4 rounds but take no lasting damage. The shame remains unresolved.
  - **Refusal to engage:** A character who refuses to face their vision at all wakes immediately but loses 1 Karma point. The Road to Redemption demands honesty.

  **JaiRuviel's Role:** In the dream, JaiRuviel appears to the character who succeeded with the highest roll. He holds a single tear, luminous, still warm. He presses it to their brow.

  *"Now you know what they see when they cry in their sleep."*

  That character receives the **Tear of Compassion** — a one-use artifact that, when presented to any being, forces absolute honesty in both directions for one conversation.

  **Waking:** All characters wake simultaneously. The Dream Cage has dissolved. JaiRuviel stands free — eyes open for the first time. He is disoriented, fragile, and looking at the party with an expression of stunned recognition.

**[24] THE FLOOD BASIN (ACT V ARENA)**
*A massive open chamber — the Facility's central processing floor. Rain Chamber pipes overhead. Hexcode Mill machinery along the walls. The floor is slightly concave, designed to drain... but the drains are old and clogged with years of crystallized tears.*

*This is where the Mogwai Rebellion happens.*

- **ACT V — THE THREE TONES:**
  JaiRuviel turns. He sings three tones none have heard before.

  **What happens next depends on earlier choices:**
  - If the party freed mogwai in Rooms 11/12: those mogwai return, drawn by the Three Tones. More allies.
  - If the party comforted mogwai: they transform first, leading the wave.
  - If the party destroyed the creche pods (Room 6): fewer gremlins to contend with but also fewer mogwai to transform.

  **The Transformation:** All mogwai in the Facility (50-100+) pause, stop crying, and transform into **Awakened Dream Dragon/Trickster Spirits**. The Coven of Seven (if any surviving members) panic and try to trigger mass gremlin transformations — throwing mogwai into water, shoving midnight bread.

  **Mass Battle (Narrative):** The GM does not need to track individual combatants. Instead:
  - Each player character chooses an action per round: **Fight** (D8 Air/Strength), **Protect** (D6 Earth/Endurance), **Inspire** (D12 Ether/Sound), or **Heal** (D20 Water/Empathy).
  - Each round, total the party's successful checks. The rebellion needs 20 cumulative successes to fully overwhelm the Coven.
  - The Coven of Seven have a collective resistance of 3 successful counter-actions per round (automatic).
  - At 20+ successes: the Coven is **drowned in the floods of their own greed** — the rain chamber pipes burst, the basin floods, and the machines become the instruments of the hags' destruction.

**[25] MACHINE CONTROL**
*A side room containing the master controls for the Rain Chambers, the Hexcode Mill, and the Facility's dream-energy distribution system.*

- **Tactical Option:** A character who reaches this room during Act V can attempt to:
  - **Reverse the rain chambers** (D4 Fire/Agility, Attainment 50%+): Floods the Facility faster, accelerating the rebellion by adding +3 to the party's success count.
  - **Overload the Hexcode Mill** (D10 Mind/Willpower, Attainment 60%+): The machine processes the mogwai transformation energy and *breaks* — sending a shockwave that stuns all hags for 2 rounds.
  - **Broadcast the Three Tones** (D12 Ether/Sound, Attainment 70%+): JaiRuviel's song is amplified through the Facility's systems, reaching mogwai even in the deepest tunnels. Adds 2D10 additional transformed allies.

**[26] THE SHATTERED CONSOLE — THE ANCIENT HAG KING'S THRONE**
*When the floods recede and the dreamshadows burn off with dawn's light filtering through cracked ceiling roots...*

*One remains.*

*A gaunt figure draped in sorrowful black, with bones that sing when he walks. He sits upon a shattered dream-processing console — the last intact piece of machinery in the Facility. He is sharpening a quill made from a stolen child's memory.*

*He had not fought. He had only watched.*

- **ACT VI — THE CHOICE:**
  The Ancient Hag King does not resist, flee, or attack. He speaks:

  *"You fools. You've broken the art. We used to harvest slowly... delicately. A single soul, bartered in dream, was a dance — not a factory."*

  *"These... modern witches. All fast food and faster spells. You think you've saved anyone? You've just started another war."*

  **The party chooses. Four futures await. See ROAD_TO_REDEMPTION_LORE_COMPENDIUM_v1.0.md, Section 8.**

  The GM should allow full in-character discussion. There is no time pressure. The dawn is breaking. The mogwai children are free. JaiRuviel kneels nearby, and the first tearless mogwai child reaches up and places their small hand on his.

  Whatever the party chooses — that is the road they walk from here.

## WANDERING ENCOUNTERS (ALL LEVELS)

| D8 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|

| 3 | **Nightmare Sentry** (1) — separated from its post, aggressive and confused |
| 4 | **Crying Pipes** — a section of dream-mucus conduit bursts, flooding 10ft area with warm tears |
| 5 | **Hag Technician** (1) — fleeing, will share info if captured, harmless if left alone |
| 6 | **Gremlin Pack** (1D6) — escaped from a failed transformation batch, chaotic and hungry |

## GM NOTES

### Pacing

- **Level 1** should feel like exploration and horror. Let the players *discover* the evil before they fight it.
- **Level 2** should feel industrial and heartbreaking. The players are inside a factory. The product is suffering.
- **Level 3** should feel dreamlike and personal. The final three acts are psychological, not physical. The party's greatest weapon is empathy.

### The D20 Water Principle

This dungeon rewards **Water/Empathy** more than any other element. This is by design. The Road to Redemption is a Water campaign. The D20, in TEK8, is the die that colonial systems destroy. This dungeon asks players to use the very thing that systems of extraction devalue most: the willingness to feel what others feel.

### Music at the Table

If players bring real instruments or sing during Sessions — especially in the Lullaby Corridor, the Eidolon Chorus Hall, or the Three Tones scene — award +10% to relevant Attainment checks. CrySword SAGA encourages real instruments. The dungeon should too.

### The Four Futures as Campaign Seeds

Each of the four endings opens a different campaign arc:
1. **Execution** → *The Dreamless War* — fight the Dreamless Guild, restore dreaming
2. **Imprisonment** → *The Bone Vault Schism* — political intrigue within the Order, dream cultist uprising
3. **Bargain** → *The Library of Stolen Sorrow* — investigate the Hag King's betrayal, hunt wrong-souled returnees
4. **Redemption** → *The Road to Saraswati* — the full Crystal Cycle campaign, the Travelling Band, the pilgrimage
