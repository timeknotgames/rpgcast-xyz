# The 64 Gemstone Species of Dice Godz
### Elemental Petal Distribution — v1.0

> *"Every stone remembers the conditions of its birth. Fire or pressure, sea or void —
> the element that forged it lives inside it still."*

These 64 gemstones are the core species of the Dice Godz system, distributed
across the 8 TEK8 elemental petals (8 species per petal). Each placement honors
traditional mineral correspondences, crystallographic properties, cultural
lineages, and the stone's own memory of formation.

## D4 — FIRE (Red) | Smiths & Tinkerers
*Stones born in heat, carrying the forge's memory*

| # | Gemstone | Resonance |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Ruby** | King of fire gems. Corundum crystallized under extreme heat and pressure. Blood vitality, courage, the heart's furnace. In Burmese tradition, a ruby inserted beneath the skin made a warrior invincible. |
| 2 | **Garnet** (Almandine) | Born in metamorphic fire deep in the crust. The warrior's lantern — Crusaders carried them; Noah hung one in the Ark for light. Pyrope variety literally means "fire-eyed." |
| 3 | **Carnelian** | Sacral fire, the ember in the belly. Ancient Egyptian "Sunset Stone" placed over the heart for courage in the afterlife. Activates creative will — the fire that makes, not destroys. |
| 4 | **Fire Opal** | Mexican volcanic glass with literal fire trapped inside silica. The Aztecs called it *quetzalitzlipyollitli* — "stone of the bird of paradise." Fire dancing inside water's structure. |
| 5 | **Sunstone** | Aventurescent feldspar that carries the sun inside it. Vikings used it to find the sun on cloudy days. Each copper platelet catches light like a tiny forge spark. |
| 6 | **Red Jasper** | The slow-burning fire. Not the flash of the forge but the banked coals that last through the night. Nurturing flame, endurance, the steady heat that transforms ore to metal over hours. |
| 7 | **Pyrite** | Iron sulfide — the literal fire-starter. Strike it and sparks fly. Called "fool's gold" by those who can't see that the ability to *make fire* is worth more than gold. The smith's first friend. |
| 8 | **Spinel** | Born in contact metamorphism at extreme temperatures. So often mistaken for ruby that the Black Prince's "Ruby" in the British Crown is actually spinel. The trickster of fire — humble origin, royal destiny. |

## D6 — EARTH (Green) | Grounders & Growers
*Stones that remember roots, soil, and the patient work of growing*

| # | Gemstone | Resonance |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 9 | **Emerald** | Heart of the earth made visible. Beryl colored green by chromium — the planet's own blood. Cleopatra's obsession. Colombian mines sacred to the Muzo people. Flaws are called *jardins* (gardens) because even emerald's imperfections grow. |
| 10 | **Jade** (Nephrite) | Tougher than steel. Chinese civilization built its spiritual vocabulary around jade — *yu* encompasses virtue, beauty, and purity. The stone of heaven found in rivers, polished by earth and water together. Interlocking crystal fibers make it virtually unbreakable. |
| 11 | **Malachite** | Banded copper carbonate, the earth showing its rings like an ancient tree. Growth made visible in green and black spirals. Sacred to miners — it warned of danger by "sweating" before cave-ins. The earth communicating through stone. |
| 12 | **Peridot** | Olivine from the earth's mantle, 20-55 miles deep. Brought to the surface only by volcanic violence. Hawaiians call it the tears of Pele — but it was the *earth's* deep heart before any volcano claimed it. One of the few gems found in meteorites — earth recognizing its kin from space. |
| 13 | **Moss Agate** | Not technically moss — manganese and iron dendrites create phantom gardens inside chalcedony. The stone that *looks like earth* without containing any organic material. European farmers placed them in fields to ensure good harvests. The earth dreaming of its own surface. |
| 14 | **Green Aventurine** | Fuchsite mica inclusions create a green shimmer like sunlight through leaves. The "gambler's stone" — not for luck but for the groundedness to take wise risks. Prosperity rooted in patience. |
| 15 | **Serpentine** | Named for its snakeskin texture — the serpent of kundalini coiled in the earth. Used by the Romans to protect against poison. A metamorphic mineral that records the earth's deep transformations in its waxy green bands. |
| 16 | **Unakite** | Epidote (green/growth) fused with feldspar (pink/heart). Named for the Unaka Mountains of North Carolina. The stone of grounded compassion — the earth teaching that strength and tenderness are one substance. |

## D20 — WATER (Blue) | Storykeepers & Healers
*Stones that carry memory, flow, and the healing depths*

| # | Gemstone | Resonance |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 17 | **Aquamarine** | Literally "sea water" in Latin. Beryl colored by iron into ocean blue-green. Sailors' talisman since antiquity — Pliny wrote it was "the treasure of mermaids." Its hexagonal crystal structure channels like a river between banks. |
| 18 | **Lapis Lazuli** | The first blue pigment in human history. Sumerian *uknû*, ground into ultramarine by Renaissance masters — Vermeer bankrupted himself buying it. Lazurite, pyrite stars, and calcite clouds — a night sky trapped in stone. The stone of *memory* across every civilization that touched it. |
| 19 | **Larimar** | Found only in one square kilometer of the Dominican Republic. Volcanic pectolite colored by copper into Caribbean sea-blue. Discovered in 1974 by Miguel Méndez, who named it for his daughter Larissa + *mar* (sea). An island stone born of fire but claimed by water. |
| 20 | **Pearl** | The only gemstone made by a living creature in water. Layer upon nacre layer — a mollusk's response to irritation becomes luminous beauty. Each pearl is a story: the record of an organism's patience with what wounds it. Time made spherical. |
| 21 | **Moonstone** | Adularescent feldspar — light scatters between microscopic layers like moonlight on water. Named for the moon that moves the tides. In Hindu tradition, made of solidified moonbeams. The stone of emotional flow and prophetic dreaming. |
| 22 | **Chrysocolla** | Hydrated copper silicate — water is literally part of its crystal structure. The stone of wise women, associated with Cleopatra's diplomatic genius. Found in copper mines where groundwater paints the stone in turquoise and teal. Teaches that softness is a form of strength. |
| 23 | **Blue Lace Agate** | Banded chalcedony in wave-like pale blue layers. Found primarily in Namibia. Each band is a geological season — the stone records time in gentle curves like ripples in a still pool. The gentlest of the water stones. |
| 24 | **Turquoise** | Sky-meeting-water. Sacred across more cultures than almost any other stone — Navajo (*doo tl'izh ii*), Persian (*pīrūzeh*), Egyptian, Tibetan. A hydrated copper aluminum phosphate that literally needs water to maintain its color. The stone that connects heaven and earth through the medium of water. |

## D8 — AIR (Cyan) | Translators & Teachers
*Stones of clarity, transmission, and the invisible made visible*

| # | Gemstone | Resonance |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 25 | **Clear Quartz** | Silicon dioxide — the most abundant mineral on earth's surface, transparent as the atmosphere. Piezoelectric: apply pressure and it generates voltage. Apply voltage and it vibrates at precise frequency. Every clock, every radio, every computer runs on quartz's ability to translate between physical and electrical. The universal translator. |
| 26 | **Fluorite** | "The Genius Stone." Calcium fluoride that fluoresces under UV light — the word *fluorescence* was coined from this mineral. Grows in perfect octahedra and cubes. Each color band represents a different moment of crystallization. The stone of systematic learning and mental organization. |
| 27 | **Celestite** | Strontium sulfate — named *caelestis* (heavenly) for its sky-blue color. Geodes of celestite look like frozen clouds. Found in sedimentary formations where ancient seas evaporated, leaving messages from vanished oceans encoded in crystal. Angelic communication stone. |
| 28 | **Blue Topaz** | Aluminum fluorosilicate. Naturally rare in blue — most is irradiated clear topaz, which is itself a teaching: invisible forces can transform the transparent into the beautiful. Throat chakra activator. The stone of articulate truth. |
| 29 | **Sodalite** | "The Poet's Stone." Royal blue with white calcite veins like clouds in a blue sky. Contains chlorine — the element of purification. Discovered in Greenland in 1811, it was the rational mind's answer to lapis lazuli's mysticism. Logic and intuition balanced. |
| 30 | **Kyanite** | Aluminum silicate that grows in blade-like crystals — sword-shaped, cutting through confusion. Unique property: hardness varies by direction (4.5 one way, 7 the other). Never accumulates negative energy, never needs cleansing, like wind that purifies by passing through. The stone of bridges and alignment. |
| 31 | **Selenite** | Hydrous calcium sulfate — gypsum in its most ethereal form. Named for Selene, moon goddess. Transparent sheets can be split infinitely thin, like peeling back layers of atmosphere. Ancient windows were made of selenite. Literally lets light pass through, as air does. |
| 32 | **Apophyllite** | "Leaf-apart" stone — peels in sheets like pages of a book. High water content but perfect tetragonal pyramids. Acts as a natural prism, refracting light into rainbows. Found in Deccan Trap basalts of India. The stone of insight, seeing through illusion — air's gift of transparency given mineral form. |

## D2 — COIN / ELECTRIC (Yellow) | Weavers & Distributors
*Stones of exchange, charge, current, and the flow of value*

| # | Gemstone | Resonance |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 33 | **Citrine** | The Merchant's Stone. Quartz colored golden by iron — shopkeepers placed it in cash registers. Never holds negative energy (one of only two such gems, with kyanite). A stone that *circulates* rather than accumulates — the essence of healthy exchange. |
| 34 | **Tiger's Eye** | Chatoyant quartz — crocidolite asbestos fibers replaced by silica, preserving the shimmer. The "eye" that follows you. Roman soldiers wore it for clear judgment in battle. Discernment of true value from false. The appraiser's stone. |
| 35 | **Amber** | Fossilized tree resin, 30-90 million years old. THE original electric stone: the Greek word *ēlektron* (amber) gives us "electricity" because rubbing amber generates static charge. Ancient Baltic trade routes — the Amber Road — were Europe's first currency networks. Value, charge, and exchange fused in one substance. |
| 36 | **Yellow Topaz** | Imperial topaz from Ouro Preto, Brazil — named for the city of "Black Gold." Solar plexus activation, willpower channeled into generosity. The stone of benevolent authority and fair distribution. |
| 37 | **Rutilated Quartz** | Golden needles of titanium dioxide (rutile) threading through clear quartz like wires through a circuit board. Each needle is a conductor. The stone of energetic networks, connecting disparate points into a functioning system. The original wiring diagram. |
| 38 | **Heliodor** | Golden beryl — "gift of the sun." Same mineral family as emerald and aquamarine, but carrying solar charge. Named by German mineralogist in 1910 from Greek *helios* (sun) + *doron* (gift). The stone of solar will channeled into purposeful giving. |
| 39 | **Yellow Sapphire** | In Jyotish (Vedic astrology), Yellow Sapphire (*Pukhraj*) is the gem of Jupiter — planet of expansion, generosity, and divine wealth. Worn on the index finger to activate dharmic prosperity. The stone of wealth that serves purpose. |
| 40 | **Chrysoberyl** | Beryllium aluminum oxide. The cat's eye variety (cymophane) was the original "cat's eye" gemstone — a single band of light sliding across the cabochon like a coin edge catching light. Vigilance in trade, protection of fair dealing. The watchful merchant's stone. |

## D10 — CHAOS (Orange) | Tricksters & Remixers
*Stones that shift, surprise, refuse to be one thing*

| # | Gemstone | Resonance |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 41 | **Opal** | Silica spheres and water arranged in chaotic-but-patterned arrays that diffract light into spectral fire. No crystal structure — it's a mineraloid, defying the rules. Australian Aboriginal creation stories say the Creator's foot touched earth and opals sprang up in rainbow fire. The trickster's crown jewel. |
| 42 | **Labradorite** | Feldspar with a secret. Turn it in the light and hidden spectra explode — blues, greens, golds that were invisible a moment ago. Called *labradorescence*, unique to this stone. Inuit legend says the Northern Lights were trapped in rock until a warrior struck it free with his spear. What you see depends on how you look. |
| 43 | **Alexandrite** | Chrysoberyl that changes color — green in daylight, red in incandescent light. Discovered in Russia's Ural Mountains on the same day Tsar Alexander II came of age. The universe's practical joke: a stone that is literally two colors depending on the light source. Duality as identity. |
| 44 | **Bismuth** | Element 83. Melted and cooled, it self-organizes into iridescent staircase fractals — hopper crystals of rainbow geometry. The most diamagnetic element, repelling magnetic fields. A metal that acts like a gem, a solid that builds impossible architecture. Chaos finding its own strange order. |
| 45 | **Ametrine** | Amethyst and citrine fused in one crystal — purple and gold, spirit and commerce, crown and solar plexus occupying the same body. Found almost exclusively in Bolivia's Anahí Mine. A stone that refuses to choose, embodying both sides of a polarity simultaneously. |
| 46 | **Bornite** (Peacock Ore) | Copper iron sulfide that tarnishes into iridescent purples, blues, and golds. Its surface never stays the same — oxidation constantly remixes its colors. Named for Austrian mineralogist Ignaz von Born. The stone of perpetual becoming, never finished, always remaking its own face. |
| 47 | **Watermelon Tourmaline** | Pink core, green rind — two colors growing concentrically in one crystal as chemical conditions shifted during formation. The boundary between elements made visible. A stone that carries its own transformation history in cross-section. |
| 48 | **Sphalerite** | Zinc sulfide with the highest dispersion of any gem — more fire than diamond. But too soft (3.5-4) for conventional jewelry. The stone that outshines the king of gems but can't survive the setting. Brilliance and fragility, potential and limitation. Chaos's gift: greatness in an impractical package. |

## D12 — ETHER (Purple) | Sonic Assemblers
*Stones that vibrate at spiritual frequencies, bridging matter and void*

| # | Gemstone | Resonance |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 49 | **Amethyst** | Quartz turned violet by iron and natural irradiation. The sobriety stone — Greek *amethystos* means "not drunk." Placed in goblets by the ancients, worn by bishops for spiritual clarity. Crown chakra key. The stone that keeps you present in higher frequencies without losing your ground. |
| 50 | **Sugilite** | Discovered 1944 by Ken-ichi Sugi, but only found in gem quality in the Wessels Mine, South Africa. Cyclosilicate — rings of silicon atoms forming hexagonal channels. Deep purple, called the "love stone of this age." Carries a frequency that only appeared to humans in the 20th century. |
| 51 | **Charoite** | Found ONLY along the Chara River in Siberia, in a single deposit. Swirling purple, white, and black — a visual representation of spiritual transformation in process. Named for the Russian word *chary* (charms/magic). A stone so rare and so specific to one place that it feels like a message from the earth meant for this era. |
| 52 | **Lepidolite** | Lithium mica — contains the same element used to stabilize mood in medicine. Lavender sheets that vibrate at a frequency of calm. The stone of transition, helping consciousness shift between states without shattering. Ether's lullaby. |
| 53 | **Tanzanite** | Zoisite found in a single 4km strip near Mount Kilimanjaro. Trichroic — blue, violet, and burgundy depending on crystal axis. Discovered in 1967 after a lightning strike set the Merelani Hills on fire, heat-treating the stones naturally. Born from lightning and earth at the foot of Africa's highest peak. |
| 54 | **Kunzite** | Spodumene variety, colored pink-lilac by manganese. Discovered 1902 by George Frederick Kunz, Tiffany's chief gemologist. Strongly pleochroic and phosphorescent — it glows after absorbing light, releasing stored energy slowly. A stone that literally hums after being charged. The sonic afterglow. |
| 55 | **Spirit Quartz** (Cactus Quartz) | A central quartz crystal encrusted with hundreds of tiny druzy points — a community of crystals growing on a single body. Found only in Magaliesberg, South Africa. Amethyst variety is purple. The stone of collective harmony — individual voices assembling into one resonance. |
| 56 | **Iolite** | Magnesium aluminum silicate. The Viking Compass Stone — its extreme pleochroism (blue/violet/yellow depending on angle) let Norse sailors locate the sun through clouds. *Ios* (Greek for violet). A stone that reveals direction through the ether when all other landmarks vanish. Third eye navigator. |

## D100 — ORDER (Indigo) | Archivists & Codemakers
*Stones of structure, precision, law, and deep record*

| # | Gemstone | Resonance |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 57 | **Diamond** | Pure carbon in a perfect tetrahedral lattice — each atom bonded to exactly four others at exactly 109.5°. The hardest natural substance, the highest thermal conductivity, the widest optical transparency. The universe demonstrating that absolute structural perfection produces adamantine beauty. The supreme codex. |
| 58 | **Sapphire** (Blue) | Corundum — aluminum oxide, second hardest natural substance. Blue from titanium and iron in precise ratio. The stone of kings, judges, and truth-seekers across every civilization. In Jyotish, Saturn's gem — the planet of karma, structure, time, and consequence. |
| 59 | **Obsidian** | Volcanic glass — silica cooled so fast it couldn't crystallize. Conchoidal fracture produces edges sharper than surgical steel (still used in some microsurgery). Aztec *tezcatl* — the smoking mirror of Tezcatlipoca. The stone of truth so precise it cuts. |
| 60 | **Hematite** | Iron oxide — literally the blood of the earth, oxidized. Streak is always red regardless of surface color. Ancient Egyptians placed it in tombs for passage to the afterlife. The most grounding stone — iron's magnetic memory organizing scattered energy into structure. |
| 61 | **Onyx** | Banded chalcedony in parallel black-and-white layers — data encoded in stone. Roman soldiers carved it into cameos and seals for official documents. The stone of discipline, self-mastery, and the commitment to hold form against entropy. |
| 62 | **Black Tourmaline** (Schorl) | Boron silicate with piezoelectric AND pyroelectric properties — generates voltage from pressure AND heat. Creates an electromagnetic field. The stone that doesn't just resist disorder but actively generates protective order around itself. |
| 63 | **Azurite** | Deep indigo copper carbonate — the stone of archives. Ancient Egyptians and Mayans ground it for pigment. It forms in copper deposits where carbonate-rich water creates ordered crystalline structures over millennia. Called the "Stone of Heaven" in Chinese tradition. Record-keeper of the mineral kingdom. |
| 64 | **Shungite** | Two-billion-year-old carbon from Karelia, Russia. Contains natural fullerenes — C60 molecules arranged in perfect soccer-ball geometry. Predates complex life on Earth. The oldest archive: a stone that remembers the planet before animals, before plants, when order was still being written. |

## Design Notes

### Placement Principles
1. **Formation memory** — Where and how the stone was born (volcanic = fire, sedimentary = water/earth, etc.)
2. **Traditional correspondences** — Ayurvedic, Jyotish, Chinese, Egyptian, Indigenous, and Western crystal traditions
3. **Physical properties** — Piezoelectricity (electric/air), color-change (chaos), hardness/structure (order)
4. **Cultural lineage** — How civilizations actually used these stones across millennia
5. **Crystallographic character** — Crystal system, habit, and optical behavior as personality

### Cross-System Integration
- Each gemstone species maps to a TEK8 guild
- Each occupies one of the 40 Rainbow Roads (8 per petal × 5 positions: OUT, UP, DWN, U45, D45)
- Species rarity can be derived from real-world geological rarity
- Gemstone hardness (Mohs scale) could map to in-game defense/resilience
- Optical properties (fluorescence, pleochroism, chatoyancy) could map to special abilities

### Regarding Corundum Siblings
Ruby (Fire) and Sapphire (Order) are both corundum — same mineral, different trace elements.
Yellow Sapphire (Coin) is also corundum. This is intentional: it mirrors how the same
base material can express completely different elemental identities depending on what
forces acted upon it. Blue Topaz (Air) and Yellow Topaz (Coin) share a similar kinship.
These cross-element mineral families create natural lore connections between guilds.
