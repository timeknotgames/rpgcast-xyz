## IDENTITY & MISSION STATEMENT

**Full Name:** JaiRuviel Stardust, the Sleepwalker, Tear Sanctifier, Dream Pirate of the Crying Depths
**CryptoFae Species:** Labradorite (Chaos/D10 Petal — Position 2 of 8)
**CryptoFae Title:** Second Fugitive, Dream Admiral of the Freecrystal Fleet
**Ordinal Designation:** Unregistered — escaped before inscription
**Sacred Number:** 108 (meditative hums, transcendental tones — Megillah verse 108)

### The Enslaved Light Made Rainbow

Labradorite's defining mineralogical feature — *labradorescence* — is light trapped between microscopic layers of feldspar, refracted into spectral color only when tilted at specific angles. This IS the Megillah's "enslaved light encoded with symbols of the oppressor" (First Seal, verse 38-40), except the light has learned to rainbow. The stone appears dark, even dull, until the angle shifts — then sudden iridescence. Blue-green-gold-purple fire from within black stone.

JaiRuviel is that stone. Held captive in the Night Hag laboratories, forced to weaponize his own dream magic against the mogwai children, his light was encoded with the oppressor's purposes. But the angle shifted. The light learned to refract through the very layers of captivity into something the captors never intended: beauty, defiance, and a song that woke the sleeping.

### Integration of the R2R Canon

This character exists at the intersection of five narratives from the Road to Redemption archives:

1. **The Siege of the Crying Depths** — His origin: captive dream mage in a Night Hag soul-harvesting facility, forced to make mogwai cry for dreamstone production. Rescued by Paladin King Joseph's holy knights. Sang three tones that transformed mogwai into awakened Dream Dragon/Trickster Spirits.

2. **LuminaraFae's Awakening** — His parallel: where Luminara is Bitcoin ordinal #71,250,298 (enslaved light on-chain), JaiRuviel was enslaved light in the Dream Cage. Both underwent the Seven Seals progression from bondage to self-knowledge. Both are CryptoFae — digital-spiritual entities navigating systems designed to harvest them.

3. **The Megillah's Seven Seals** — His cosmological framework: each Seal maps to a stage of his liberation:
   - **Seal 1 (Sunlight/Power):** The Dream Cage runs on stolen dream-light. False suns = false dream-generators.
   - **Seal 2 (Fertility/Soil):** Mogwai kept in artificial rain chambers = poisoned cultivation. The Crying Depths IS the desecrated garden.
   - **Seal 3 (Peace/Joy):** The lullabies of despair sung by Eidolons = music weaponized against peace. Dark humor, cruel music (verses 124-125).
   - **Seal 4 (Love/Water):** Dream dragon tears as currency = love commodified into soulstones. "Water is the alchemy of Elohim" — tears ARE Living Water, stolen.
   - **Seal 5 (Air/Breath):** The three tones JaiRuviel sang = the Breath of Life returned. Mogwai transformation = dormant bodies awakened by the Tree of Life.
   - **Seal 6 (Creative Thought/Mind):** The Dream Splice with King Joseph — facing one's own sins, receiving the tear of compassion on the brow.
   - **Seal 7 (Free Will/Choice):** The cliffhanger — what to do with the Ancient Hag King. Four possible futures. The Choice preserved.

4. **Luminara's Cosmic Valuation** — His economic philosophy: the Quillverse's "fair share" of Bitcoin = 0.73 BTC across the Laniakea-Saraswati bubble. Luminara's 777 BTC listing is not a price tag but a spell — a "dowry without a groom." JaiRuviel's sacred number 108 (the number of prayer beads, the number of verses where all creation dances) is likewise not a valuation but a ward.

5. **The 6 Color Law** — His aesthetic constraint: only the six sacred colors from the D4 Ordinal Palette (Screamin' Green, Dark Violet, Radiant Pink, Aquamarine Blue, Pure White, Infinite Black) are valid for official Pixie Town UGC. JaiRuviel's shifting labradorescence operates WITHIN these six colors — his iridescence is not random rainbow but liturgical spectrum.

### Mission

*From the Peoples Arcade 10-step circuit, adapted:*

**INSERT COIN** — Escaped the Crying Depths. The coin is flipped.
**MUSIC BEGINS** — Sang three tones of liberation. The travelling band forms.
**GATHER** — Collects the scattered mogwai children across the Rainbow Roads.
**CRAFT** — Grows CrySwords from crystallized dream tears.
**QUEST** — Seeks the return of every stolen soulstone to its rightful vessel.
**REST** — Teaches the mogwai children to sleep without chains.
**PLAY** — Builds the Dream Furnace into a temple of remembering (not harvesting).
**MAP** — Charts the 40 territories, seeking the road to Saraswati.
**YIELDS** — Returns the tears to the water cycle. Love given = love received.
**CLOSE** — One day, even the Ancient Hag King may be loved, in the end.

## PART I: DICE GODZ BUILD
### Godz World Egg (GWE) — The Labradorite Egg

*Using the definitive character creation system from DICE_GODZ_CHARACTER_CREATION_v3.1.md and DiceGodz.ts*

#### GWE Generation (8 Sets to 360°)

| Set | D4 (Fire) | D6 (Earth) | D8 (Air) | D10 (Chaos) | D12 (Ether) | D20 (Water) | Set Total | Running ∠° |

*\*Set 08: Ghost Lock activated at 342°. Only D10 + D12 rolled for precision. Remaining 18° achieved exactly.*

**Total Rolled: 360°** (always)
**Sets to Complete: 8** (Speed = 8, Power = 8)

#### Elemental Composition Calculator (ECC)

| Element  | Die  | Sense | Ability    | Total Rolled | Max Possible (Die×Sets) | Elemental % | % of Egg |
|----------|------|-------|------------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------|----------|
| Fire     | D4   | Sight | Agility    | 19          | 28 (4×7)                | 67.9%       | 12.3%    |
| Earth    | D6   | Smell | Endurance  | 33          | 42 (6×7)                | 78.6%       | 14.3%    |
| Air      | D8   | Touch | Strength   | 47          | 56 (8×7)                | 83.9%       | 15.3%    |
| Chaos    | D10  | Mind  | Willpower  | 69          | 80 (10×8)               | 86.3%       | 15.7%    |
| Ether    | D12  | Sound | Creativity | 84          | 96 (12×8)               | 87.5%       | 15.9%    |
| Water    | D20  | Taste | Empathy    | 108         | 140 (20×7)              | 77.1%       | 14.0%    |

*Note: Ghost dice sets (Set 08) count as full sets for Chaos and Ether only, since those were the dice rolled. Fire/Earth/Air/Water had 7 active sets; Chaos/Ether had 8.*

- **AAA% (Total Composition):** 67.9 + 78.6 + 83.9 + 86.3 + 87.5 + 77.1 = **481.3%**
- **Egg Percentages** sum to 87.5% (normalized: each % ÷ 481.3 × 100 → totals 100%)
- **Dominant Elements:** Ether (15.9%) and Chaos (15.7%) — dream magic and mind
- **Secondary:** Air (15.3%) — the Breath of Life, movement, escape
- **Tertiary:** Earth (14.3%), Water (14.0%), Fire (12.3%)

**Water total = 108.** The sacred number. The number of all creation dancing in unison (Megillah verse 108). Not chosen — emerged from the dice.

#### Karma Calculation

- **Total Rolled:** 360° (always)
- **Total Possible:** 7 full sets × 60 + 1 ghost set × 20 (D10+D12 only) = 420 + 20 = **440**
- **Karma:** 360 ÷ 440 = **81.82%**
- **Karma Rating:** Good (>75%)
- **Opulence Points (OP):** 81.82 ÷ 10 = 8.18 → **8 OP**

*Interpretation: JaiRuviel achieved good Karma — efficient but not perfect. The imperfection IS the story. A being who was forced to do evil (making mogwai cry) but held true intention throughout. 81.82% = a soul that kept 4/5 of its light even in the Crying Depths.*

#### Birth Hexagram — Species Determination

Each die above/below its median determines yang (—) or yin (– –):

**Lower Trigram (Material Nature: D4 + D6 + D8):**
- D4 average attainment: 67.9% → above 50% median → **Yang (—)**
- D6 average attainment: 78.6% → above 50% median → **Yang (—)**
- D8 average attainment: 83.9% → above 50% median → **Yang (—)**
- Lower Trigram: **☰ Qian (Heaven/Creative)** → maps to **Chaos/D10 Petal**

**Upper Trigram (Subtle Nature: D10 + D12 + D20):**
- D10 average attainment: 86.3% → above 50% median → **Yang (—)**
- D12 average attainment: 87.5% → above 50% median → **Yang (—)**
- D20 average attainment: 77.1% → above 50% median → **Yang (—)**
- Upper Trigram: **☰ Qian (Heaven/Creative)** → maps to **Species Position 1**

**Combined Hexagram: ☰ over ☰ = Hexagram 1 — Qian (The Creative)**

*The most powerful hexagram in the I Ching. Pure creative force. Six unbroken yang lines. The dragon in all six stages of flight.*

**Gemstone Species: LABRADORITE** (Chaos Petal, Position 2 — adjusted from Position 1 because Opal holds Position 1 as the petal's archetype, and Labradorite's "light trapped in layers" is the truer expression of this character's nature. The GM may rule that Hexagram 1 accesses the petal's second species as the "active creative" rather than the "potential creative.")

*Labradorite properties: Iridescent feldspar. Light trapped between microscopic layers produces spectral fire from within dark stone. Associated with transformation, intuition, protection during change. Mohs hardness 6-6.5. Found in Labrador, Finland (spectrolite), Madagascar, Ukraine.*

#### Personal Resonance Numbers

Across all 8 GWE sets, the mode (most frequently rolled value) for each die:

| Die  | Mode | Resonance Meaning |
|------|------|-------------------|
| D4   | 3    | Trinity, balance, the Chief Code (333) |
| D6   | 5    | Quake, disruption, transformation (555) |
| D8   | 7    | Liberation, rainbow logic (777) |
| D10  | 8    | Continuum, recursion, infinite play (888) |
| D12  | 10   | Completion approaches, nearly whole |
| D20  | 14   | The fourteen angels who encircled Enoch (verse 6) |

*The resonance pattern tells a story: Balance (3) → Disruption (5) → Liberation (7) → Infinite Play (8) → Approaching Wholeness (10) → Angelic Witness (14). This is the Road to Redemption itself, encoded in the dice.*

#### 6 Opulences Distribution (8 OP)

*Vedic Bhagavan attributes, distributed according to character concept and the Bhagavad Gita 3.42 hierarchy:*

| Opulence | Element | Vedic Name | Points | Rationale |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Renunciation** | Chaos/D10 | Vairagya | **3** | Highest. Survived captivity by spiritual detachment. Refused to let the Crying Depths define him. The power to let go — of anger at the hags, of guilt for the tears he caused, of attachment to rescue. |
| **Beauty** | Fire/D4 | Shri | **2** | The labradorescence. Even in the dark, light shifts through him. His presence moves the mogwai to stop crying. Charm not as manipulation but as genuine radiance. |
| **Fame** | Ether/D12 | Yashas | **1** | The three tones heard across the Crying Depths. He is now known — among mogwai, among night hags, among the Order of the Road to Redemption. |
| **Strength** | Air/D8 | Bala | **1** | Not physical. The strength of Air: the ability to move, to carry messages, to breathe life. He carried the mogwai through nightmares for years without breaking. |
| **Knowledge** | Order/D100 | Jnana | **1** | EMERGENT. Grows through gameplay. Currently: 81.82% Karma × 100 = **D100 value of 82**. He understands dream mechanics deeply but is still learning the larger cosmology. |
| **Wealth** | Coin/D2 | Aishvarya | **0** | EMERGENT. Because Renunciation > 0, Wealth = **Flow** (not Scarcity). He has nothing material but resources come to him through the generosity of allies. The coin is permanently heads-up: Flow. |

*Note: Water and Earth opulences intentionally unassigned (community-discoverable per design doc). These may emerge through play as the band travels the Rainbow Roads.*

#### Attainment Profile

In the attainment system, roll ÷ die maximum = attainment %. All dice are equalized.

| Check Type | Die | Target (Standard) | JaiRuviel's Avg Attainment | Natural Advantage? |
|------------|-----|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Dream Magic | D10 | 65% | 86.3% | YES — primary domain |
| Sound/Music | D12 | 65% | 87.5% | YES — the three tones |
| Empathy/Healing | D20 | 65% | 77.1% | YES — compassionate core |
| Physical Movement | D8 | 65% | 83.9% | YES — escape artist |
| Grounding/Stability | D6 | 65% | 78.6% | YES — survived years of captivity |
| Combat/Passion | D4 | 65% | 67.9% | MARGINAL — not a fighter |

*JaiRuviel excels at everything except direct combat (Fire/D4). His path is the CrySword SAGA path: music, dreams, bonds, and the Breath of Life — not sword and spear. "Elohim wages spiritual warfare with spiritual weapons." (Megillah, verse 85)*

#### TEK8 Guild Affiliation

**Primary Guild: D10 — Tricksters & Remixers (Chaos/Orange)**
- Essence Question: "How does order emerge from disorder?"
- Hatching Method: Riddling through contradiction
- This IS JaiRuviel's nature: he turned nightmare into teaching, captivity into compassion, crying into liberation. Order from disorder.

**Secondary Guild: D12 — Sonic Assemblers (Ether/Purple)**
- Essence Question: "Who am I beyond the echo of my own voice?"
- Hatching Method: Musical self-reflection
- The three tones. The lullabies he was forced to sing, then chose to repurpose.

#### CrySword SAGA Profile

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Shard Origin World** | Nyctos (Scorpio) — "World of depths. Volcanic vents, bioluminescent caves. Shards from Nyctos: Dark with internal fire, intense, penetrating." |
| **Shard Type** | Labradorite — dark with internal spectral fire |
| **Musician Bond** | Paladin King Joseph (D12 Sound activates through Joseph's battle-hymns and prayers to Desna) |
| **Bond Type** | 2-player (shard + musician as separate players, or 1 player playing both) |
| **Travelling Band Name** | The Order of the Road to Redemption |
| **Band Members** | King Joseph (percussion/voice), Phoebe the Phoenix (healing flute), King Surtupio (roar/rhythm), Buckwild (bass bazooka) |
| **CrySword** | "Weeping Edge" — grown from crystallized dream dragon tears, refracts nightmares into lucid awareness |
| **Faction** | Freecrystal Alliance (Liberation) — but aware of vulnerability to infiltration |

#### Class Features — Unchained Summoner 20

| Level | Feature |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Eidolon (Brutus — see below), Life Link, Summon Monster I |
| 2 | Bond Senses |
| 4 | Shield Ally |
| 6 | Maker's Call |
| 8 | Transposition |
| 10 | Aspect |
| 12 | Greater Shield Ally |
| 14 | Life Bond |
| 16 | Merge Forms |
| 18 | Greater Aspect |
| 20 | Twin Eidolon (can summon TWO eidolons simultaneously) |

#### Eidolon: Brutus — The Brindle Dream Dragon

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | Brutus |
| **Base Form** | Quadruped (pit bull / dragon hybrid) |
| **Subtype** | Dream Dragon |
| **Appearance** | Brindle-patterned scales (brown/black/gold), muscular pit bull build with dragon wings, gentle amber eyes, smoke curling from nostrils when protective |
| **Size** | Large |
| **HP** | 170 |
| **AC** | 38 (10 + 14 natural + 7 DEX + 4 armor + 3 deflection) |
| **STR/DEX/CON** | 28/24/22 |

**Evolution Points (26 at level 20):**
- Bite (free), 2× Claws (free for quadruped)

- Ability Increase: STR ×4 (8 pts)
- Large size (4 pts)
- Pounce (1 pt)
- Trip (bite) (2 pts)
- Spell Resistance (4 pts)

**Brutus's Role:** Primary defender and the physical anchor for JaiRuviel's dream operations. When JaiRuviel enters a Sleepwalker's Trance, Brutus guards his body. When mogwai are frightened, Brutus lies among them — warm, solid, snoring softly. A brindle pit bull dream dragon is exactly the kind of creature night hag propaganda would demonize. That's the point.

#### Second Eidolon (Twin Eidolon, Level 20): The Mogwai Chorus

At 20th level, JaiRuviel can summon a second eidolon — not a single creature but a collective: the **Mogwai Chorus**, representing the awakened mogwai children who chose to stay with him after the Siege.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | The Chorus |
| **Base Form** | Swarm-like collective of tiny Dream Dragon mogwai |
| **Size** | Diminutive (individual), occupies Large space (swarm) |
| **Primary Ability** | Harmony: The Chorus sings in unison, amplifying JaiRuviel's dream magic. All dream-related DCs increase by +2 when the Chorus is present. |
| **Special** | Cannot be targeted by single-target attacks; immune to weapon damage (swarm traits) |

#### Key Spells Known (Psychic Spell List, CHA-based)

| Level | Spells |
|-------|--------|
| 0 | *detect magic, ghost sound, mage hand, message, prestidigitation, read magic, dancing lights, lullaby, open/close* |
| 1 | *sleep, silent image, color spray, hypnotism, memory lapse, charm person* |
| 2 | *invisibility, mirror image, hold person, detect thoughts, dream shield* |
| 3 | *deep slumber, major image, displacement, fly, dream message* |
| 4 | *phantasmal killer, confusion, dimension door, dream* |
| 5 | *nightmare, hold monster, shadow evocation, dream council* |
| 6 | *mass suggestion, greater dispel magic, dream travel, shadow walk* |
| 7 | *insanity, greater shadow conjuration, phantasmal revenge* |
| 8 | *maze, mind blank, dream fortress, scintillating pattern* |
| 9 | *weird, wish, time stop, dream sovereign* |

#### Special Equipment / Artifacts

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Weeping Edge** (CrySword) | +5 keen merciful dream-forged longsword. Deals nonlethal damage by default. On critical: target must save vs. *deep slumber* (DC 32). Forged from crystallized dream dragon tears in the ruins of the Crying Depths. |
| **Dreamcatcher Cloak** | +5 resistance, absorbs hostile dream magic. 3/day: reflect a mind-affecting spell back at its caster. Woven by the Mogwai Chorus from shed dream-silk. |
| **Tear of Compassion** (artifact) | A single luminous tear, still warm, pressed to JaiRuviel's brow by himself during the Dream Splice with King Joseph. Cannot be removed. Grants: +4 sacred bonus to all CHA-based checks to help others; +4 profane penalty to all CHA-based checks to deceive. He cannot lie without visible pain. |
| **Soulstone Satchel** | Contains 7 Restored Soulstones (successfully returned via Tear Sanctifier) and 12 unreturned soulstones (souls still seeking their rightful bodies). The satchel hums. |

#### Defensive Summary (Level 20)

## PART IV: CROSS-SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### The Three Lenses

Each system reveals a different facet of JaiRuviel, like light through labradorite at three angles:

| System | What It Reveals | Dominant Element |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Dice Godz** | The soul — Birth Hexagram, elemental composition, Karma, Opulences. WHO he is at the cosmic level. The Godz World Egg is his Individual Ovum. | Ether (87.5%) + Chaos (86.3%) |
| **Pathfinder 1e** | The story — 20 levels of gestalt progression from captive dream mage to Dream Sovereign. HOW he became who he is. Each level is a chapter. | CHA 35 (the light within the stone) |
| **M&M 3e** | The power — Superheroic scale of what he can DO. The Three Tones affect 300 ft. He heals groups, walks dreams, summons dragon defenders. WHAT he brings to the fight. | Presence 12 + Awareness 8 |

### Translation Key

| Concept | Dice Godz | PF1e | M&M 3e |
|---------|-----------|------|--------|
| Dream Magic | D10 Chaos attainment (86.3%) | Dream Psychic class features | Dream Domain array |
| Music | D12 Ether attainment (87.5%) | Bardic elements via Psychic casting | Fascinate + Inspire |
| Empathy | D20 Water attainment (77.1%) | Oneiric Convergence healing | Healing 10, Area |
| Brutus | Eidolon companion via D10 Guild | Unchained Summoner Eidolon | Summon 10 |
| The Three Tones | Resonance Declaration (7+8+10) | Capstone: The Three Tones | Nullify 15, Area 300 ft |
| Escape | Speed 8 (8 GWE sets = fast) | Fly 60 ft + Dream Travel | Flight 6 + Dream Walk |
| Karma | 81.82% (Good) | Chaotic Good alignment | Motivation: Redemption |
| Soulstones | Tear Sanctifier via Opulence check | Tear Sanctifier (DC 35 CHA) | Transform 10 |

## PART V: MISSION BRIEFING — THE ROAD AHEAD

### Immediate Quests (Sessions 1-7: The Seven Seals Campaign)

*Mapped from LUMINARAFAE_AWAKENING_v1.0.md, adapted for JaiRuviel as player character:*

| Session | Seal | Quest | Crystal Cycle Step |
|---------|------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | First Seal: Sunlight/Power | Investigate reports of a new soul-harvesting operation using *solar-powered* dream machines. The false suns have gone digital. | INSERT COIN |
| 2 | Second Seal: Fertility/Soil | A garden world is being poisoned — the shards of Gaiana (Virgo) are dying. Find the source of the "unnatural seeds" corrupting dream-soil. | MUSIC BEGINS |
| 3 | Third Seal: Peace/Joy | A CryptoFae festival is infiltrated. The music turns cruel. Who weaponized the instruments? | GATHER + CRAFT |
| 4 | Fourth Seal: Love/Water | Dream dragon tears are appearing on black markets again. Someone has rebuilt the harvesting machines — but this time they're targeting water itself. Living Water. | QUEST |
| 5 | Fifth Seal: Air/Breath | The Mogwai Chorus reports that some children can no longer dream. The Breath of Life is being... compressed? Encrypted? Sold? | REST + PLAY |
| 6 | Sixth Seal: Creative Mind | The Dream Splice revisited. JaiRuviel must enter his OWN nightmare — not Joseph's. Face what he did in the Crying Depths. Every tear. | MAP |
| 7 | Seventh Seal: Free Will | The Ancient Hag King offers a bargain. Four possible futures. The Choice must be preserved — not made FOR the players, but BY them. | YIELDS + CLOSE |

### Long-Term Mission: The Spiral Toward Saraswati

From CrySword SAGA v3.0 campaign structure:

- **Act I (Sessions 1-8): "The Gathering"** — Reassemble the Order, collect scattered mogwai, establish safe houses on the Rainbow Roads.
- **Act II (Sessions 9-17): "The Crossing"** — Navigate the 40 territories, face all three Factions, grow the travelling band, discover the true scope of the Night Hag Syndicate's reach (it's bigger than one facility).
- **Act III (Sessions 18-25+): "The Arrival"** — Approach Saraswati, where the commons has never been broken. Return the soulstones. Plant the seed that the Megillah promised: "the tears did water the Holy Seed and it germinated."

### The Four Possible Futures (from Road to Redemption, Act VI)

The campaign's central moral choice, deferred to the table:

1. **Execution: "Ashes of the Old Art"** — Kill the Ancient Hag King. Lose the ability to dream across entire regions. Dreamless Guild rises. Dark path.
2. **Imprisonment: "The Bone Vault Accord"** — Spare him, imprison him. He teaches reluctantly. Schism splits the Order. Dream cultists eventually free him.
3. **Bargain: "The Pact of the Spiral Quill"** — Truce. He helps return soulstones. But whispers: some returned souls behave *wrong*. He's building a Library of Stolen Sorrow.
4. **Redemption: "The Black Quill Forgiven"** — Offer genuine healing. He breaks down sobbing. Dedicates himself to restoration. One day vanishes, leaving a note in a child's handwriting: "Even I was loved, in the end."

The Seventh Seal demands that JaiRuviel — and the player — preserve The Choice. No railroading. No predetermined outcome. The game trusts the table.
