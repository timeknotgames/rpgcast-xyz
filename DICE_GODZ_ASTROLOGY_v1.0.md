## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

v3.1 teaches the progression: **Senses → Mind → Intelligence → Wealth.**
The Numerology system (v1.0) teaches: **every number speaks.**
The Astrology system extends upward: **the sky at your birth speaks too — and it speaks in many languages.**

In most RPGs, astrology is flavor — a zodiac sign on the character sheet, maybe a minor bonus. Dice Godz treats astrology as a **pluriversal lens**: the same sky, seen through 40+ cultural traditions, revealing different truths about the same character.

This is the TEK8 principle applied to the cosmos: no single system of star-knowledge dominates. Western astrology is one lens. Vedic Jyotish is another. Polynesian star navigation is another. Chinese Ershíbā Xiù is another. Each is valid. Each reveals something the others don't. The character who learns to read their birth sky through multiple traditions gains the deepest self-knowledge — just as Intelligence (D100/Order) emerges from the pattern of ALL the senses, not just one.

### The Core Tool: Stellarium

**Stellarium** is a free, open-source planetarium available as:
- **Desktop application** (Windows, Mac, Linux): https://stellarium.org
- **Web application** (any browser, no install): https://stellarium-web.org

Stellarium maps the sky for any date, time, and location on Earth. It includes **40+ sky cultures** — different civilizations' constellation systems, star names, and celestial mythologies. It is the only freely available tool that treats the sky as genuinely multicultural.

Dice Godz uses Stellarium as an oracle: set it to the moment of your character's birth, and the sky itself tells you who you are — differently, depending on which tradition reads it.

---

## PART I: THE BIRTH SKY

### When Is a Character "Born"?

In v3.1, a character comes into existence when the Godz World Egg is complete — the moment the total exceeds 360°. The **Birth Moment** is:

- **For in-person play:** The real-world date, time, and location when the final GWE set is rolled.
- **For online play:** The real-world date and time when the final set is rolled; location defaults to the player's physical location or a fictional game-world location chosen by the group.
- **For pre-generated characters:** The GM assigns a birth moment — a historical date, a fictional date, or a deliberately chosen astronomical event.

**Record on the character sheet:**
```
BIRTH SKY
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Time: [HH:MM local time]
Location: [City/Region or Lat/Long]
```

### Looking Up the Birth Sky

**Using Stellarium Web (quickest method):**

1. Go to https://stellarium-web.org
2. Click the **clock icon** and set the date/time to the Birth Moment
3. Click the **location pin** and set the location
4. Look UP — what is directly overhead? (The zenith)
5. Look to the **horizon lines** — what is rising in the East? Setting in the West?
6. Click the **culture icon** (globe or book symbol) to switch between sky cultures
7. Record what you see through at least 2–3 different cultural lenses

**Using Stellarium Desktop (richer experience):**

1. Set date/time/location in the bottom toolbar
2. Press **F4** to access Sky Culture settings
3. Cycle through cultures: Western, Chinese, Hindu, Egyptian, Polynesian, Lakota, Arabic, etc.
4. For each culture, note which constellation is overhead, rising, and setting
5. Stellarium desktop includes more sky cultures and richer descriptions than the web version

### What to Record

For each sky culture consulted, note:

| Sky Culture | Overhead Constellation | Rising (East) | Setting (West) | Dominant Star |
|------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Western | [e.g., Sagittarius] | [e.g., Gemini] | [e.g., Scorpio] | [e.g., Antares] |
| Vedic/Hindu | [e.g., Dhanus] | [e.g., Mithuna] | [e.g., Vrischika] | [e.g., Jyeshtha] |
| Chinese | [e.g., Xiù of the day] | | | |
| Polynesian | [e.g., navigator star line] | | | |
| [Player's choice] | | | | |

This is the character's **Pluriversal Birth Chart** — the same sky seen through many eyes.

## PART II: THE STAR SIGNS

### Multiple Signs, One Character

Unlike conventional RPGs that assign ONE zodiac sign, Dice Godz gives each character as many star signs as they choose to explore. Each cultural lens reveals a different facet:

#### Western Zodiac (12 Signs)

Based on the Sun's position at the Birth Moment. The most familiar system worldwide.

| Sign | Element (Western) | TEK8 Element Resonance | Character Tendency |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Aries | Fire | D4 Fire / Agility | Initiator, pioneer |
| Taurus | Earth | D6 Earth / Endurance | Builder, sustainer |
| Gemini | Air | D8 Air / Strength | Communicator, adapter |
| Cancer | Water | D20 Water / Empathy | Nurturer, protector |
| Leo | Fire | D4 Fire / Agility | Creator, leader |
| Virgo | Earth | D6 Earth / Endurance | Analyst, healer |
| Libra | Air | D8 Air / Strength | Harmonizer, diplomat |
| Scorpio | Water | D20 Water / Empathy | Transformer, revealer |
| Sagittarius | Fire | D4 Fire / Agility | Explorer, teacher |
| Capricorn | Earth | D6 Earth / Endurance | Strategist, builder |
| Aquarius | Air | D8 Air / Strength | Innovator, rebel |
| Pisces | Water | D20 Water / Empathy | Dreamer, mystic |

#### Vedic Jyotish (27 Nakshatras)

Based on the Moon's position in the 27 lunar mansions. More granular than Western — 27 divisions vs. 12.

Each Nakshatra has a ruling deity, a symbol, and a planetary lord. Stellarium's Hindu sky culture shows the Nakshatra divisions. Key Nakshatras and their TEK8 resonance:

| Nakshatra | Symbol | TEK8 Resonance | Quality |
|-----------|--------|---------------|---------|
| Ashvini | Horse head | Air (D8) — speed, healing | New beginnings |
| Rohini | Ox cart | Earth (D6) — growth, beauty | Creativity, fertility |
| Ardra | Teardrop | Water (D20) — storm, cleansing | Transformation through destruction |
| Pushya | Lotus | Ether (D12) — nourishment | Spiritual expansion |
| Magha | Throne | Order (D100) — authority, ancestry | Connection to lineage |
| Swati | Coral | Air (D8) — independence, wind | Freedom, self-sufficiency |
| Mula | Root | Chaos (D10) — investigation, uprooting | Getting to the bottom of things |
| Revati | Fish/drum | Water (D20) — completion, journey | Safe passage, wealth |

*(Full 27-Nakshatra table in the Dice Godz Core Rulebook)*

#### Chinese Twenty-Eight Mansions (二十八宿)

The 28 Xiù divide the sky along the celestial equator. Each mansion is associated with an animal and one of the 4 directional spirits:

- **Azure Dragon** (East, 7 mansions) → TEK8: Water/Ether
- **Black Tortoise** (North, 7 mansions) → TEK8: Earth/Order
- **White Tiger** (West, 7 mansions) → TEK8: Air/Fire
- **Vermilion Bird** (South, 7 mansions) → TEK8: Fire/Chaos

#### Polynesian Star Lines

Polynesian navigation uses **star lines** — sequences of stars that rise from and set to the same point on the horizon. A character born under a strong star line has a natural direction — a path written in the sky.

Key star lines and TEK8 resonance:
- **Hōkūleʻa** (Arcturus) — the star of joy, the zenith star of Hawaiʻi → Ether (D12), Creativity
- **Hōkūpaʻa** (Polaris) — the fixed star, the anchor → Order (D100), Focus
- **ʻAʻā** (Sirius) — the burning one, brightest star → Fire (D4), Agility
- **Kaiwikuamoʻo** (the Milky Way) — the backbone of the sky → the GWE itself, the 360° arc

#### Additional Sky Cultures in Stellarium

Stellarium includes sky cultures from: Lakota, Navajo, Inuit, Māori, Egyptian, Babylonian, Norse, Korean, Japanese, Macedonian, Romanian, Mongolian, Tupi-Guarani, Tukano, Kamilaroi, Tongan, and more.

Each provides a different reading of the same sky. A character's Birth Sky is a **palimpsest** — layers of meaning from different traditions, all coexisting, all true.

## PART III: THE TEK8-CELESTIAL MAP

### Planets and Elements

Classical and modern astrology assigns planets to qualities. TEK8 maps them to elements:

| Celestial Body | Western Association | Vedic (Graha) | TEK8 Element | Connection |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------|-----------|----|
| **Sun** | Vitality, ego | Sūrya | Fire (D4) | The source of sight, the light that reveals |
| **Moon** | Emotion, intuition | Chandra | Water (D20) | Tides, cycles, empathy's mirror |
| **Mercury** | Communication, intellect | Budha | Air (D8) | The messenger, the breath that carries words |
| **Venus** | Beauty, love, value | Shukra | Fire (D4) + Coin (D2) | Shri (beauty) and Aishvarya (wealth) |
| **Mars** | Energy, conflict, drive | Mangala | Chaos (D10) | The fire of will, the warrior's mind |
| **Jupiter** | Wisdom, expansion, dharma | Guru/Brihaspati | Ether (D12) | The teacher, the expansive sound |
| **Saturn** | Discipline, time, karma | Shani | Order (D100) | The lord of consequences, the pattern enforcer |
| **Rahu** (North Node) | Desire, illusion, ambition | Rahu | Chaos (D10) | The shadow that disrupts to teach |
| **Ketu** (South Node) | Liberation, detachment, past | Ketu | Coin (D2) | Renunciation, the release that generates wealth |

### Celestial Events as Gameplay Triggers

The GM can use real astronomical events (checked via Stellarium) or fictional calendar events to create gameplay effects:

| Event | Effect | Duration |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Solar Eclipse** | Fire (D4) checks temporarily at disadvantage; Chaos (D10) enhanced | 1 session |
| **Lunar Eclipse** | Water (D20) checks heightened — both harder and more consequential | 1 session |
| **Planetary Conjunction** | The two elements associated with the conjuncting planets resonate — rolls on both get +1 | Until planets separate |
| **Solstice** (summer) | Fire element at maximum — all Fire-aligned characters feel empowered | 1 day in-game |
| **Solstice** (winter) | Water element at maximum — all Water-aligned characters feel the pull of deep empathy | 1 day in-game |
| **Equinox** | All elements in balance. Attainment calculations are exact (no rounding). Truth-telling is easier; deception is harder. | 1 day in-game |
| **Meteor shower** | Ether (D12) floods — creativity surges, prophetic dreams are common, Creativity checks at advantage | Duration of shower |
| **Visible comet** | Rare event. An NPC or narrative element enters the story. Comets are messengers. | Until comet fades |

### Star Affinity Bonus

If a character's dominant element matches the currently prominent celestial body (e.g., a Fire-dominant character during a period when Mars is visible and bright), they receive a **Star Affinity Bonus: +1 to all checks on that element's die** for the duration.

The GM determines celestial prominence either by:
- Checking Stellarium for the current in-game date
- Using a simplified seasonal calendar
- Declaring it narratively when it serves the story

This mechanic rewards players who pay attention to the sky — real or fictional. It teaches the same lesson as TEK: *look up.*

## PART IV: ASTROLOGY IN CHARACTER CREATION

### Integration with v3.1 Walkthrough

The astrology system adds to v3.1 without modifying it:

| v3.1 Step | Astrology Addition |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Step 1: Prepare** | **Note the date, time, and location** of the ritual. This becomes the Birth Moment. |
| **Step 2–8: GWE** | No changes — roll as normal |
| **After Step 9** | **Consult Stellarium.** Look up the Birth Sky. Record star signs from 2–3 cultural traditions. |
| **After Step 9** | **Determine Star Affinity.** Which planet was most prominent at birth? That planet's element gains a permanent +1 affinity marker (not a stat bonus — a narrative affinity that the GM may invoke). |
| **Step 10: Enter the World** | The character is born under a specific sky. Their story includes "I was born when [star/constellation] was overhead, which in the [tradition] means..." |

### What Gets Added to the Character Sheet

```
ASTROLOGICAL PROFILE
═══════════════════════
Birth Moment: [Date] [Time] [Location]

Star Signs:
  Western:     [Sign] — [Constellation overhead]
  Vedic:       [Nakshatra] — [Ruling deity]
  Chinese:     [Xiù] — [Directional spirit]
  Polynesian:  [Star line] — [Navigation meaning]
  [Other]:     [Player's choice of additional sky culture]

Dominant Planet at Birth: [Planet] → [TEK8 Element affinity]
Star Affinity: [Element] (+1 narrative affinity)

Current Sky Notes: [Updated periodically as celestial events occur]
═══════════════════════════
```

## PART V: ASTROLOGY IN PLAY

### The Sky as Living Calendar

Unlike most RPG calendar systems (which are arbitrary), Dice Godz can use the **real sky** as its calendar. The GM checks Stellarium for the current in-game date and announces:

- What season it is (solstice/equinox proximity)
- Which planets are visible tonight
- Whether any notable celestial events are occurring
- What the moon phase is

This grounds the game world in astronomical reality. Players who look up at the real sky between sessions will recognize the same stars their characters see. The game and the world share a sky.

### Moon Phases and the GWE

The moon's phase at character creation has a subtle effect:

| Moon Phase | Effect on GWE | Narrative Flavor |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **New Moon** | Ghost Lock Threshold reduced to 330° (slightly earlier strategic play) | Born in darkness — the character must find their own light |
| **Waxing Crescent** | No mechanical change | Born in growth — the character's potential is expanding |
| **First Quarter** | No mechanical change | Born at the crossroads — a decisive character |
| **Waxing Gibbous** | No mechanical change | Born in anticipation — something is building |
| **Full Moon** | Water (D20) rolls gain +1 during GWE | Born in fullness — empathy is heightened at creation |
| **Waning Gibbous** | No mechanical change | Born in the time of sharing — generosity in the character's nature |
| **Last Quarter** | No mechanical change | Born at the crossroads of release — a character who lets go |
| **Waning Crescent** | Ghost Lock Threshold extended to 336° (slightly later strategic play) | Born in the thin time — between worlds, between breaths |

### Stellarium as Navigation Tool (In-Game)

Characters in CrySword SAGA travel between worlds, through space, across the Saraswati Supercluster. Navigation is a core activity. Stellarium becomes a literal in-game tool:

- **Which stars guide you?** Depends on which sky culture your character knows.
- **A Polynesian navigator** reads star lines and can find any island (or planet) on their line.
- **A Vedic astrologer** reads Nakshatras and can time journeys for auspicious departures.
- **A Western astronomer** reads coordinates and can calculate trajectories.
- **All approaches work.** The pluriversal principle: different knowledge systems arrive at the same destination through different paths.

Characters who learn multiple sky cultures gain navigational advantage — they can cross-reference systems, identify stars by multiple names, and find paths that mono-cultural navigators miss.

This mechanic rewards cultural curiosity. The game literally becomes easier the more traditions you engage with seriously.

---

## PART VI: THE ZODIAC WORLDS

### CrySword SAGA's 13 Zodiac Worlds

CrySword SAGA v2.0 established **13 Zodiac Worlds** — planets/stations positioned along zodiacal lines. The astrology system enriches these:

Each Zodiac World has:
- A **Western zodiac** association (its "sign")
- A **Vedic Nakshatra** cluster
- A **TEK8 elemental alignment**
- A characteristic **sky** — what does the sky look like from THIS world? (Stellarium can model views from other solar system bodies)

Characters traveling to a Zodiac World whose sign matches their own birth sign receive a **Homecoming Bonus** — the sense of being in the right place under the right stars. Mechanically: +1 to all checks while on that world.

Characters on a Zodiac World whose sign OPPOSES their birth sign face the **Stranger's Challenge** — everything feels slightly off, requiring greater effort. Mechanically: one fewer resonance invocation per session.

### Star Maps as Treasure

In CrySword SAGA, **star maps from different sky cultures** are valuable items. A Polynesian star map of the Saraswati Supercluster would be priceless to a navigator trained only in Western coordinates. Star maps are:

- **Tradeable** — a form of Wealth (Aishvarya)
- **Cultural artifacts** — possessing one implies a relationship with the tradition that produced it
- **Navigation keys** — without the right map in the right tradition, certain routes are hidden
- **Teaching tools** — studying a star map from an unfamiliar culture grants Knowledge (Jnana) experience

---

## PART VII: CULTURAL SHARING GUIDELINES FOR ASTROLOGY

### What We Are Doing

This system draws from astrological and astronomical traditions including:
- **Western astrology** (Greek-Roman-Arabic synthesis, 12 zodiac signs)
- **Vedic Jyotish** (27 Nakshatras, 9 Grahas, Dashas — one of the world's most sophisticated mathematical astrological systems)
- **Chinese astronomy** (28 Mansions, 4 Directional Spirits, calendar science)
- **Polynesian navigation** (star lines, zenith stars, non-instrument wayfinding — arguably the greatest navigational achievement in human history)
- **Egyptian decans** (36 star-groups marking 10-day periods)
- **Lakota, Navajo, and other Indigenous star knowledge** (as represented in Stellarium's growing library)
- **Babylonian star catalogs** (the oldest systematic astronomical records)

### Guidelines for Players

1. **Stellarium is a gateway, not an authority.** Stellarium's sky culture descriptions are introductory. For any tradition that resonates with you, seek primary sources — books by practitioners, courses taught by cultural bearers, museums and planetariums with indigenous astronomy programs.

2. **Star knowledge is sacred knowledge in many traditions.** Polynesian navigation was closely guarded for centuries. Vedic Jyotish is a *Vedanga* — a limb of the Vedas. Some indigenous star stories are ceremonial and not meant for casual use. When Stellarium labels a sky culture as contributed by cultural practitioners, honor the spirit in which it was shared.

3. **Navigation knowledge saved lives.** Polynesian wayfinding enabled the settlement of the Pacific — the largest migration in human history. This is not a game mechanic. It is a living tradition practiced today by navigators like Nainoa Thompson and the Polynesian Voyaging Society. If this game leads you to learn about *Hōkūleʻa*, follow that thread to its source.

4. **Multiple systems does not mean "all the same."** The pluriversal approach says every system reveals something true. It does NOT say they are interchangeable. Western and Vedic astrology calculate different things using different zodiacs (tropical vs. sidereal). Chinese mansions track different stars than Indian Nakshatras. Learn the differences with the same care you'd bring to learning different languages.

5. **Reciprocity.** If Polynesian navigation enriches your gameplay, support the Polynesian Voyaging Society. If Vedic Jyotish deepens your character, find a qualified Jyotish teacher and learn properly. If indigenous star knowledge opens your eyes to a different sky, support indigenous astronomy education. This is the Wealth mechanic: **Flow requires giving back.**

## PART VIII: PRACTICAL REFERENCE

### Quick-Start Astrology for New Players

If a player wants to add astrology without deep research, here's the minimum:

1. **Record your Birth Moment** (date/time/location when you finished rolling the GWE)
2. **Go to stellarium-web.org** and set it to that moment
3. **Check Western view**: What zodiac constellation is the Sun in? That's your Sun Sign.
4. **Check one other culture**: Switch sky cultures and note what's overhead. Write it down.
5. **Done.** You have two star signs from two traditions. Explore more when you're ready.

### Quick-Reference: Western Zodiac → TEK8 Element

| Zodiac | Dates (approx) | Western Element | TEK8 Element |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Aries | Mar 21–Apr 19 | Fire | D4 Fire |
| Taurus | Apr 20–May 20 | Earth | D6 Earth |
| Gemini | May 21–Jun 20 | Air | D8 Air |
| Cancer | Jun 21–Jul 22 | Water | D20 Water |
| Leo | Jul 23–Aug 22 | Fire | D4 Fire |
| Virgo | Aug 23–Sep 22 | Earth | D6 Earth |
| Libra | Sep 23–Oct 22 | Air | D8 Air |
| Scorpio | Oct 23–Nov 21 | Water | D20 Water |
| Sagittarius | Nov 22–Dec 21 | Fire | D4 Fire |
| Capricorn | Dec 22–Jan 19 | Earth | D6 Earth |
| Aquarius | Jan 20–Feb 18 | Air | D8 Air |
| Pisces | Feb 19–Mar 20 | Water | D20 Water |

*Note: This uses the tropical zodiac. Vedic Jyotish uses the sidereal zodiac, which is shifted ~24° and yields different dates. Both are correct within their own frameworks. Neither is "the real one." This is the pluriversal principle at the level of the ecliptic.*

### Moon Phase Quick Lookup

Players can check moon phase for any date at: https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases/ or within Stellarium itself.

## APPENDIX: WHY STELLARIUM?

### Open Source, Open Sky

Stellarium is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It is:
- **Free** — no cost to any player
- **Open source** — the code is available, modifiable, and auditable
- **Community-maintained** — sky cultures are contributed by cultural practitioners and astronomers worldwide
- **Cross-platform** — runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and in web browsers
- **Accurate** — uses professional astronomical catalogs and calculations

This aligns with the TEK8 principle of **commons over enclosure**. The sky belongs to everyone. The tool that maps the sky should too.

### Stellarium's Sky Culture Library

As of 2025, Stellarium includes sky cultures from:

Western, Chinese, Egyptian, Hindu/Vedic, Korean, Japanese, Lakota, Navajo, Polynesian (Tuamotuan), Tongan, Māori, Inuit, Norse, Macedonian, Romanian, Mongolian, Kamilaroi (Australian Aboriginal), Tukano (Brazilian Indigenous), Arabic (traditional and modern), Babylonian, Belarusian, Boorong (Australian Aboriginal), Bugis (Indonesian), Dakota, Hawaiian, Lokono (Arawak), Maya, Ojibwe, Sami, Sardinian, Siberian, Thai, and more being added regularly.

Each sky culture relabels the SAME stars with DIFFERENT constellations, names, and stories. This is the most visceral demonstration of pluriversalism available: look at the same sky, see different worlds. All real. None supreme.
