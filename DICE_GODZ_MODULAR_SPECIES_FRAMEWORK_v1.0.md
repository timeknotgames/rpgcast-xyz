# The Modular Species Framework
## Iterative Drafting, Player Adaptation & IRL Garden Integration
### Dice Godz / TEK8 / Quillverse — v1.0

> *"The system is the seed. Your tradition is the soil. What grows is yours."*

---

## PART I: MODULAR ARCHITECTURE

### 1.1 Design Philosophy

The 64 Gemstone Species system is designed as a **living framework** — not a
fixed canon. The initial v1.0 arrangement represents one well-researched
starting point, but the system's power comes from its ability to be adapted
by players according to their own:

- **Cultural heritage** (e.g., a Diné player places Turquoise in Air)
- **Lived experience** (e.g., a jeweler reclassifies stones by workability)
- **Geographical knowledge** (e.g., a Brazilian player adds Paraíba Tourmaline)
- **Spiritual practice** (e.g., a Jyotish practitioner follows Navaratna)
- **Agricultural expertise** (e.g., a biodynamic farmer maps by soil function)

### 1.2 The Three Layers

Every gemstone species has three layers that can be modified independently:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 3: CULTURAL RESONANCE   │ ← Player-customizable
│  (Name, story, tradition,      │
│   healing property, lineage)   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER 2: ELEMENTAL PLACEMENT  │ ← Community-adjustable
│  (Which petal, which position, │
│   boundary species markers)    │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER 1: MINERAL IDENTITY     │ ← Fixed (scientific truth)
│  (Chemical formula, hardness,  │
│   crystal system, formation)   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Layer 1** is immutable — Quartz is always SiO₂, Mohs 7, trigonal.
**Layer 2** is adjustable within documented bounds — the Genesis Council
identified 7 boundary species with alternative placements.
**Layer 3** is fully customizable — players bring their own stories.

### 1.3 Boundary Species Protocol

Seven stones have been identified by the Genesis Council as **boundary species**
that can legitimately occupy multiple petals:

| Stone | Default Petal | Alternative Petal(s) | Tradition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Turquoise | Water (D20) | Air (D8) | Pueblo, Diné: sky stone |
| Obsidian | Order (D100) | Fire (D4), Chaos (D10) | Mexica: Tezcatlipoca; Geology: volcanic |
| Emerald | Earth (D6) | Air (D8) | Jyotish: Mercury's gem |
| Diamond | Order (D100) | Coin (D2), Ether (D12) | Jyotish: Venus; Sanskrit: Vajra |
| Selenite | Air (D8) | Earth (D6), Water (D20) | Agriculture: gypsum; Etymology: Moon |
| Amethyst | Ether (D12) | Earth (D6) | Hildegard: cold/dry humour |
| Chrysoberyl | Coin (D2) | Ether (D12) | Jyotish: Ketu (liberation) |

**Rule:** When a player moves a boundary species to an alternative petal,
the vacated slot can be filled by a stone from the **Regional Species Pool**
(Section 1.5) or left empty (creating strategic asymmetry).

### 1.4 The 64-Fold Symmetry

The number 64 is not arbitrary. It connects to four existing Dice Godz systems:

| System | Count | Connection |
|---|---|---|
| **64 Kalas** (Traditional Arts/Skills) | 64 | Each gemstone species grants affinity to one Kala |
| **64 Garu Eggs** (Companion/Identity) | 64 | Each egg hatches into / bonds with one gemstone species |
| **64 Phenomena** (Terrain/Environment) | 64 | Each phenomenon is the habitat where one species forms |
| **64 Custom Skill Slots** (Character Sheet) | 64 | Species-specific abilities fill these slots |

This means every gemstone species has:
- A **skill** it teaches (from the 64 Kalas)
- A **companion** it bonds with (from the 64 Garu Eggs)
- A **habitat** it calls home (from the 64 Phenomena)
- A **special ability** it grants (custom skill slot)

### 1.5 Regional Species Pool

Beyond the core 64, players and communities can propose **regional species** —
gemstones significant to their geography or culture that aren't in the
initial framework. Examples:

| Region | Proposed Species | Petal | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Caribbean | Red Coral | Fire or Water | Navaratna requirement; reef ecosystem |
| Minnesota/Plains | Pipestone (Catlinite) | Fire | Sacred pipe stone; red = fire |
| Brazil | Paraíba Tourmaline | Coin/Electric | Copper-bearing; neon glow; rare value |
| Australia | Boulder Opal | Chaos | Matrix opal; Aboriginal dreamtime |
| Afghanistan | Lapis var. Badakhshan | Water | Ancient Silk Road source |
| Mexico | Cantera Opal | Chaos | Fire-in-matrix; volcanic |
| Sri Lanka | Padparadscha Sapphire | Ether | Lotus color; rarest sapphire |
| Oregon/USA | Sunstone (Oregon) | Fire | Copper-bearing; state gem |

**Submission process:** Players submit regional species with:
1. Mineral identity (Layer 1 data)
2. Proposed petal and rationale
3. Cultural/personal significance story (Layer 3)
4. At least one source citation

Regional species don't replace core 64 — they join the extended species pool.

## PART II: ITERATIVE DRAFTING PROCESS

### 2.1 Version Lifecycle

```
v1.0 (CURRENT)    → Initial intuitive placement
v1.1 (COUNCIL)    → Genesis Council critique applied
v1.2 (COMMUNITY)  → First community feedback round
v2.0 (PLAYTEST)   → Post-playtesting refinement
v2.x (SEASONAL)   → Quarterly updates from play data
v3.0 (CANONICAL)  → Stable release after 1 year of play
```

### 2.2 Revision Governance

Changes to the gemstone species system follow this process:

**Layer 1 changes** (mineral identity corrections): Immediate, no vote needed.
If we got the Mohs hardness wrong, fix it.

**Layer 2 changes** (elemental reclassification): Require documented support
from at least 2 of the 7 Council perspectives. Changes must be proposed in
writing with citations, discussed for at least 1 week, and approved by the
Quillverse council or game designer.

**Layer 3 changes** (cultural resonance updates): Open and continuous. Players
can always add stories, healing resonances, and cultural notes to any species.
These are additive — they never delete existing lore, only extend it.

### 2.3 Playtesting Feedback Loops

Each playtest session should record:

1. **Species Encounters:** Which gemstone species did players interact with?
2. **Placement Friction:** Did any species feel "wrong" in its petal?
3. **Mechanic Balance:** Are hardness-based defense stats too swingy?
4. **Cultural Response:** Did any player from a relevant tradition object to
   a placement?
5. **Garden Integration:** If using the garden system, what grew well in
   which petal-beds?

### 2.4 The Living Codex

All gemstone species data lives in a **Living Codex** — a versioned document
(or database) that records:

```
species_id: 17
name: "Aquamarine"
mineral_formula: "Be₃Al₂Si₆O₁₈ (beryl)"
mohs_hardness: 7.5-8
crystal_system: "hexagonal"
formation: "hydrothermal pegmatite"

petal: "D20-Water"
position: "OUT" (Outer Ring — beginning exploration of water)
boundary_species: false

kala_affinity: "Kala 17: Swimming (AGI + END)"
garu_egg: "Egg 17: Tide Dreamer"
phenomenon_habitat: "Phenomenon 17: Oceanic Abyss"
custom_ability: "Depth Sight — see through murky water"

healing_resonance: "Soothes throat ailments and fear of speaking"
hardness_defense: 8
elemental_attack_die: D20

cultural_notes: [
  {tradition: "Roman", note: "Pliny NH 37.20: beryl family, eight varieties"},
  {tradition: "Latin", note: "Aqua marina = sea water"},
  {tradition: "Sailor", note: "Talisman against drowning since antiquity"}
]

lineage: [] // Filled by players as the stone is traded/inherited
garden_zone: "Water petal bed: rain garden, water features, leaf vegetables"
soil_function: "None direct (silicate mineral, inert in soil)"
```

---

## PART III: GAME MECHANICS INTEGRATION

### 3.1 Species Stats (Derived from Mineral Properties)

Each gemstone species generates game stats from its real mineral properties:

| Mineral Property | Game Stat | Formula |
|---|---|---|
| Mohs Hardness | **Defense** | Hardness value (1-10 scale) |
| Crystal System | **Stability** | Cubic=10, Hex=8, Trig=7, Ortho=6, Tetra=5, Mono=4, Tri=3, Amorph=2 |
| Piezoelectric? | **Charge** | Yes=+3 bonus to Coin/Electric actions |
| Pleochroic? | **Shifting** | Yes=+2 bonus to Chaos actions |
| Fluorescent? | **Glow** | Yes=+2 bonus to Ether actions |
| Specific Gravity | **Weight** | Mapped to carry capacity / throw distance |
| Formation Temp | **Forge Affinity** | High=Fire bonus, Low=Water bonus |

**Example — Ruby:**
- Defense: 9 (Mohs 9)
- Stability: 7 (Trigonal)
- Charge: No
- Shifting: No (but dichroic = mild pleochroism, +1 Chaos)
- Glow: Yes (fluorescent under UV, +2 Ether)
- Weight: SG 4.0 = Medium
- Forge Affinity: High temp metamorphic = +2 Fire

### 3.2 Integration with 64 Kalas

Each gemstone species maps 1:1 with a Kala (traditional art/skill). The
mapping follows elemental-thematic logic:

| Petal | Kalas (Sample) | Gemstone Species |
|---|---|---|
| Fire (D4) | Kala 3: Cooking (CHA+END) | Ruby |
| Fire (D4) | Kala 10: Jewelry Setting (AGI+INT) | Garnet |
| Earth (D6) | Kala 41: Mineralogy/Akara-Jnana (INT+PER) | Emerald |
| Water (D20) | Kala 17: Swimming (AGI+END) | Aquamarine |
| Air (D8) | Kala 14: Rhetoric (CHA+INT) | Clear Quartz |
| Coin (D2) | Kala 59: Gambling/Dyuta-Visesha (LCK+INT) | Citrine |
| Chaos (D10) | Kala 40: Gem Tinting/Mani-Raga (INT+PER) | Opal |
| Ether (D12) | Kala 1: Singing (CHA+PER) | Amethyst |
| Order (D100) | Kala 42: Architecture (INT+WIL) | Diamond |

The complete 1:1 mapping should be collaboratively determined during
playtesting, with each species granting **Minor affinity (+10 bonus, x2 XP)**
to its linked Kala when bonded.

### 3.3 Integration with 64 Garu Eggs

Each Garu Egg contains a sacred philosophical question. When hatched, the Garu
bonds with one gemstone species. The elemental alignment determines the bond:

| Egg Type | Element | Gemstone Bond Pool |
|---|---|---|
| Eggs 0-7 | Pure elemental | First stone of each petal (Ruby, Emerald, Aquamarine...) |
| Eggs 8-22 | Two-element combos | Boundary species and cross-element resonances |
| Eggs 23-57 | Complex combos | Multi-elemental species (Opal, Labradorite, Ametrine) |
| Eggs 58-63 | High-element combos | Diamond, Shungite, Spirit Quartz (universal resonance) |
| Egg 64 | Rainbow Bridge (all) | Player's choice — any species |

### 3.4 Integration with 64 Phenomena

Each Phenomenon is a terrain/biome generated by elemental combinations.
Gemstone species *inhabit* these phenomena as their native habitat:

| Phenomenon | Elements | Habitat Gemstones |
|---|---|---|
| 0: Pure Ether | Ether | Amethyst |
| 8: Magma Flow | Fire+Earth | Garnet, Peridot |
| 15: Crystal Formation | Earth+Ether | Emerald, Jade |
| 20: Storm Front | Air+Chaos | Labradorite, Alexandrite |
| 34: Tidal Pool | Water+Earth | Pearl, Turquoise |
| 62: Akashic Library | Fire+Air+Ether+Chaos | Diamond |
| 64: Rainbow Bridge | All Six | Opal (all colors) |

### 3.5 Integration with Combat (360-Degree System)

Each gemstone species modifies the 360-degree combat angle system:

- **Angle Bonus:** Species grants +15% when attacking from its element's angle
  (e.g., Ruby grants +15% at 90-135° / Fire quadrant)
- **Elemental Defense:** Species grants resistance to opposing element attacks
  (e.g., Ruby resists Water attacks at 135-180°)
- **Shard Evolution:** Gemstone species can evolve Crystal Shards to higher
  tiers. A Fire shard bonded to Ruby reaches Tier 2 (Harmonized) faster than
  one bonded to a non-fire species.

### 3.6 Integration with Godz World Egg (GWE) Creation

During character creation's 360-degree dice-rolling process:

- **Species Bonus Dice:** If your character's primary gemstone is from a
  specific element, you may reroll that element's die once during GWE creation
- **Ghost-Lock Modification:** Certain species reduce the ghost-lock threshold
  (normally 27 degrees) by their Mohs hardness value, giving more flexibility
  in the final rolls
- **Elemental Attunement:** After GWE completion, your highest-percentage
  element determines which gemstone species "chooses" you as a starter

## PART IV: THE IRL GARDEN SYSTEM

### 4.1 The Eight-Petal Mandala Garden

Based on the permaculture mandala garden design (Woodrow, 1996), the Dice Godz
garden maps the TEK8 elemental system onto a physical growing space:

```
                    N (Ether/D12)
                   ╱  ╲
          NW      ╱    ╲      NE
        (Coin/D2)╱ Center╲(Air/D8)
               ╱  (Water  ╲
        W ────╱   Feature) ╲──── E
      (Order ╱              ╲(Fire
       D100)╲              ╱  D4)
              ╲            ╱
        SW     ╲          ╱     SE
      (Chaos    ╲        ╱  (Earth
        D10)     ╲      ╱    D6)
                  ╲    ╱
                   ╲  ╱
                    S (Water/D20)
```

**Construction:**
- Center: Water feature (pond, birdbath, or rain barrel) — honoring Albertus
  Magnus's principle that water is the universal medium of gem formation
- 8 beds radiating outward, ~1.2m wide, ~3m long
- Keyhole paths between beds, ~0.6m wide
- Outer ring: perennial border with fruit trees/bushes
- Total diameter: ~10m (adjustable to space)

### 4.2 Planting Guide by Petal

| Petal | Direction | Plants | Crystal Grid | Soil Amendment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fire (D4)** | E/SE | Tomatoes, peppers, sunflowers, marigolds, basil | Ruby, Carnelian, Sunstone | Pyrite-derived sulfur |
| **Earth (D6)** | SE/S | Carrots, beets, potatoes, garlic, mushroom logs | Jade, Moss Agate, Malachite | Rock dust, comite |
| **Water (D20)** | S | Lettuce, spinach, cabbage, taro, watercress | Aquamarine, Moonstone, Pearl shell | Gypsum (selenite family) |
| **Air (D8)** | NE/E | Lavender, rosemary, sage, mint, chamomile | Clear Quartz, Celestite, Fluorite | Ground quartz (BD 501) |
| **Coin (D2)** | NW/N | Bee balm, sunflowers, buckwheat, clover (pollinators) | Citrine, Tiger's Eye, Amber | Greensand (potassium) |
| **Chaos (D10)** | SW/W | Wildflower mix, volunteer crops, experimental varieties | Opal, Labradorite, Bismuth | Azomite (60+ minerals) |
| **Ether (D12)** | N | Night-blooming jasmine, moonflowers, white sage, lavender | Amethyst, Charoite, Iolite | Minimal — meditation space |
| **Order (D100)** | W/NW | Heritage varieties, seed-saving crops, formal geometries | Diamond (sim), Sapphire, Hematite | Iron-rich amendments |

### 4.3 Stone Placement (Māori Thermal Principle)

Following the Māori kumara garden tradition (Furey, SAP 235):

- **Dark stones** (Obsidian, Hematite, Black Tourmaline) placed on south-facing
  bed edges absorb maximum solar heat and radiate it at night
- **Light stones** (Clear Quartz, Selenite, Moonstone) placed on north-facing
  edges reflect light deeper into beds
- **Medium stones** mixed into soil of raised mounds for thermal mass

This is not metaphysical speculation — it's proven agricultural engineering
that extended Māori growing seasons by one month in temperate New Zealand.

### 4.4 Seasonal Rituals

| Season | Element Active | Garden Action | Stone Ceremony |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Spring Equinox** | Air (new growth) | Plant flower/herb beds | Place Quartz in Air bed; spray BD 501 |
| **Summer Solstice** | Fire (full sun) | Plant fruit/seed crops | Place Ruby/Sunstone in Fire bed |
| **Autumn Equinox** | Earth (harvest) | Harvest roots; save seeds | Place Jade in Earth bed; thank soil |
| **Winter Solstice** | Water (rest) | Mulch; plan; compost | Place Moonstone by water; dream |
| **Cross-quarters** | Chaos/Ether/Coin/Order | Experimental planting, pollinator support, seed exchange | Rotate boundary species |

### 4.5 Companion Planting by Elemental Affinity

The TEK8 Creation Cycle (Fire→Earth→Water→Air→Fire) maps to companion
planting relationships:

- **Fire feeds Earth:** Peppers and tomatoes (fire) companion-plant with
  carrots (earth) — the tall plants shade root crops
- **Earth feeds Water:** Root crops break soil, improving water infiltration
  for leaf crops in adjacent beds
- **Water feeds Air:** Moisture from leaf-crop transpiration supports aromatic
  herbs in neighboring beds
- **Air feeds Fire:** Aromatic herbs repel pests from fruiting crops

The Opposition Axis creates **antagonist plantings** to avoid:
- Fire vs. Water: Don't plant peppers next to lettuce (bolting risk)
- Air vs. Earth: Don't plant mint next to carrots (flavor contamination)

## PART V: COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATION SYNTHESIS

### 5.1 The Unified 64-Fold System

The 64 Gemstone Species tie together ALL existing Dice Godz systems into
one coherent framework:

```

```

### 5.2 Character Creation Flow (with Gemstones)

```
1. CHOOSE CRYSTAL SCHOOL → Determines primary element/guild
2. ROLL GODZ WORLD EGG  → 360° dice determine elemental composition
3. RECEIVE STARTER GEM   → Highest-% element assigns starter gemstone species
4. HATCH GARU EGG       → Egg bonds with gemstone, granting Kala affinity
5. ENTER PHENOMENON     → Gemstone's native habitat becomes starting zone
6. BEGIN EXPLORATION     → Discover additional species across Rainbow Roads
```

### 5.3 Gemstone Discovery Mechanics

Players discover new gemstone species through gameplay:

| Discovery Method | Difficulty | Location |
|---|---|---|
| **Territory Exploration** | Easy | Walk Rainbow Roads; common species at OUT positions |
| **Deep Mining** | Medium | DWN positions in each petal; rare species |
| **Elemental Convergence** | Hard | U45/D45 positions; boundary species appear at element crossings |
| **Champion Sessions** | Variable | TTRPG sessions can award species discoveries as loot |
| **Garden Growing** | Slow | IRL garden petal-beds "grow" species over real seasons |
| **Trade & Gift** | Social | Players trade species; stones carry lineage (Pounamu principle) |

### 5.4 Species Rarity (Based on Real-World Geological Rarity)

| Rarity | Real-World Criterion | Species Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Common** | Abundant globally | 24 | Clear Quartz, Amethyst, Jasper, Agate varieties |
| **Uncommon** | Regionally abundant | 20 | Emerald, Turquoise, Lapis Lazuli, Moonstone |
| **Rare** | Few known sources | 12 | Tanzanite (one location), Larimar, Charoite, Alexandrite |
| **Legendary** | Exceptional specimens | 8 | Diamond (gem quality), Ruby (pigeon blood), Padparadscha, Sphalerite |

### 5.5 CryptoFae Connection

The existing 8 CryptoFae species (from rpgcast-xyz database) each align with
one petal. The 64 gemstone species become **subspecies** or **evolution paths**
for CryptoFae:

| CryptoFae | Petal | Gemstone Evolution Pool |
|---|---|---|
| Ethersong | D12 Ether | Amethyst, Sugilite, Charoite, Lepidolite, Tanzanite, Kunzite, Spirit Quartz, Iolite |
| Zephling | D8 Air | Clear Quartz, Fluorite, Celestite, Blue Topaz, Sodalite, Kyanite, Selenite, Apophyllite |
| Emberkin | D4 Fire | Ruby, Garnet, Carnelian, Fire Opal, Sunstone, Red Jasper, Pyrite, Spinel |
| Tideling | D20 Water | Aquamarine, Lapis, Larimar, Pearl, Moonstone, Chrysocolla, Blue Lace Agate, Turquoise |
| Stoneheart | D6 Earth | Emerald, Jade, Malachite, Peridot, Moss Agate, Green Aventurine, Serpentine, Unakite |
| Trickwisp | D10 Chaos | Opal, Labradorite, Alexandrite, Bismuth, Ametrine, Bornite, Watermelon Tourmaline, Sphalerite |
| Codex | D100 Order | Diamond, Sapphire, Obsidian, Hematite, Onyx, Black Tourmaline, Azurite, Shungite |
| Fortunate | D2 Coin | Citrine, Tiger's Eye, Amber, Yellow Topaz, Rutilated Quartz, Heliodor, Yellow Sapphire, Chrysoberyl |

### 5.6 Cross-System Character Sheet Integration

The Multi-System Character Sheet (quilltangle_v8) already supports Dice Godz
with 8 elemental stats. The gemstone species system adds:

```typescript
