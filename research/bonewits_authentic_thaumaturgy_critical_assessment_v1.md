## 1. Who Was Isaac Bonewits?

### Biography

Philip Emmons Isaac Bonewits (October 1, 1949 -- August 12, 2010) was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, the fourth of five children, with a Presbyterian father and Catholic mother. He grew up in Ferndale, Michigan, moved to San Clemente, California at age 12, attended Catholic high school briefly, then graduated public school a year early.

He enrolled at UC Berkeley in 1966 and graduated in 1970 with what is often cited as the first and only Bachelor of Arts in Magic from an accredited university. This was an interdisciplinary studies degree combining anthropology, sociology, psychology, folklore, and mythology. The degree is real but must be understood in context: UC Berkeley's interdisciplinary program allowed students to define their own majors, and Bonewits was a skilled self-promoter who understood the publicity value of this credential.

### Organizational Involvement

- **Reformed Druids of North America (RDNA)**: Joined in 1966, ordained as a Neo-druid priest in 1969.
- **Church of Satan**: Briefly recruited at age 18, left due to philosophical conflicts with Anton LaVey.
- **Ar nDraiocht Fein (ADF)**: Founded this public Neopagan Druid organization in 1983; served as Archdruid until 1996, then Archdruid Emeritus until his death.
- Various involvements with Ordo Templi Orientis, Gardnerian Wicca, and the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn.

### Key Publications

- *Real Magic: An Introductory Treatise on the Basic Principles of Yellow Magic* (1971) -- his first major work, written while still at Berkeley.
- *Authentic Thaumaturgy* (1st ed. 1978 via Chaosium; 2nd ed. 1998/2005 via Steve Jackson Games).

### Era and Context

Bonewits was a product of the late 1960s Bay Area counterculture, the early Neopagan revival, and the first wave of RPG culture. He wrote during a period when Neopaganism was small, intellectually scrappy, and fighting for legitimacy. His rhetorical combativeness -- the constant swipes at Christianity ("the Religious Reich"), skeptics, and atheists -- reflects this embattled position. He was not an academic anthropologist, not a historian of religion, and not a game designer by training. He was a practitioner-advocate who brought real passion and genuine erudition, but also significant blind spots and biases.

### Personal Controversies

In 2017, Moira Greyland (daughter of author Marion Zimmer Bradley) published *The Last Closet: The Dark Side of Avalon*, alleging that Bonewits sexually molested her when she was six years old, in 1972, while he was living in the household of author Diana Paxson. Bonewits, who died in 2010, never publicly responded to these allegations.

In November 2019, ADF formally repudiated Bonewits as its founder, stating: "To preserve the health of our organization, we must cut out the blight that is Isaac Bonewits' legacy. We sever the ties both historical and spiritual that bind us to him. For his actions against children, Isaac Bonewits will no longer be named as a beloved ancestor of ADF, nor is he welcome at our sacred fire."

This context matters for anyone citing Bonewits as an authority. His own organization found the allegations credible enough to repudiate him. While this does not automatically invalidate the intellectual content of his work, it does affect his standing as a trusted authority figure, and it is part of the full picture that anyone recommending his work should be aware of.

## 2. What Is "Authentic Thaumaturgy"?

### Publication History

- **1st Edition (1978)**: Published by Chaosium (the RuneQuest/Call of Cthulhu publisher). Subtitled "A Professional Occultist on Improving the Realism of Magic Systems Used in Fantasy Simulation Games."
- **2nd Edition (1998, reprinted 2005)**: Published by Steve Jackson Games as a system-agnostic supplement, with significant revisions.

### Content

The book presents:
1. An extended essay on what Bonewits considers "real" magic to be, drawn from his own Neopagan practice and his reading of anthropological and occult sources.
2. His "Laws of Magic" -- a taxonomy of approximately 26 principles that he claims underlie all magical practice worldwide.
3. A proposed RPG magic system based on these laws, intended to simulate "realistic" magic in tabletop games.

### The 26 Laws of Magic

These include (among others):
- **Law of Knowledge**: Understanding brings control.
- **Law of Self-Knowledge**: Know thyself.
- **Law of Cause and Effect**: Same actions under same conditions produce same results.
- **Law of Synchronicity**: Temporally coincident events share deeper associations.
- **Law of Association**: Patterns with common elements interact through those elements.
- **Law of Similarity**: Accurate representations facilitate control (from Frazer).
- **Law of Contagion**: Objects once in contact continue to interact after separation (from Frazer).
- **Law of Names**: Knowing the true name gives power over the named.
- **Law of Words of Power**: Certain words alter reality.
- **Law of Personification**: Any phenomenon may be treated as alive and possessing personality.
- **Law of Invocation/Evocation**: Internal and external communication with entities.
- **Law of Identification**: Merging with another entity.
- **Law of Positive/Negative Attraction**: Like attracts like; like attracts unlike.
- **Law of Infinite Data/Finite Senses**: There is more data than we can perceive.
- **Law of Perversity**: Murphy's Law applied to magic.
- **Law of Unity**: All phenomena are interconnected.

Bonewits described these as "not legislative laws but, like those of physics or of musical harmony, practical observations that have been accumulating over the course of thousands of years, with remarkable similarity in almost every known human culture."

## 3. Bonewits' Sources and the Question of Originality

### What He Drew From

Bonewits' "Laws of Magic" are not original discoveries. They are a synthesis -- sometimes acknowledged, sometimes not -- of existing Western sources:

**James George Frazer's *The Golden Bough* (1890)**
The Laws of Similarity and Contagion are taken directly from Frazer's framework of "sympathetic magic." Frazer himself was an armchair anthropologist who never did fieldwork, relied on second-hand accounts from missionaries and colonial administrators, and organized non-Western practices into a progressive schema (magic -> religion -> science) that is now recognized as deeply Eurocentric. Bonewits acknowledges Frazer but does not adequately critique Frazer's methodology or its colonial assumptions.

**Edward Burnett Tylor's *Primitive Culture* (1871)**
Tylor's concept of "psychic unity of humankind" -- the idea that all human minds work essentially the same way -- underpins Bonewits' claim that his laws are universal. Tylor's framework arranged cultures on a spectrum from "savagery" through "barbarism" to "civilization," treating non-European peoples as living fossils illustrating earlier stages of human development. This is the intellectual ancestry of Bonewits' universalism.

**Margaret Murray's Witch-Cult Hypothesis**
Bonewits uncritically cites Murray's *The Witch-Cult in Western Europe* (1921) and its thesis that medieval witchcraft was a survival of pre-Christian pagan religion. This thesis was comprehensively debunked by historians in the 1960s-70s (notably by Norman Cohn and Keith Thomas). Bonewits' reliance on Murray undermines his claim to scholarly rigor.

**Golden Dawn / Western Ceremonial Magic Tradition**
The structure of Bonewits' thinking -- the emphasis on correspondences, names of power, invocation/evocation distinctions, and systematic taxonomizing of magical operations -- derives from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and its intellectual descendants. The Golden Dawn itself was a syncretic Victorian-era organization that wove together Kabbalah, Tarot, Enochian magic, Egyptian symbolism, astrology, and alchemy into a hierarchical curriculum.

**Theosophy (Paradoxically)**
Bonewits references concepts like the Akashic Record and the tripartite Aura while simultaneously dismissing Theosophy as nonsense and critiquing Blavatsky. This inconsistency has been noted by reviewers.

### What He Did Not Adequately Credit

The synthesis itself -- combining Frazer's categories with occult practice and trying to create a unified framework -- was novel in the context of 1970s Neopaganism. But the individual components were not original. Bonewits presented his taxonomy with an authority that implied more originality than the work contained. A Goodreads reviewer notes: "So much of what his book contains regarding magic is Bonewits' own categorization rather than a look at overall magic categorization."

---

## 4. Critiques of the Work

### From Within Neopagan Communities

- **Selective Tradition**: Bonewits privileges his own Neopagan/Druidic framework while dismissing practitioners whose systems differ. He was particularly hostile to Chaos Magic, which the Refereeing and Reflection blog calls "the most significant development in 'real world' magic since the original Authentic Thaumaturgy edition."
- **Rhetorical Substitution for Argument**: Multiple reviewers note that Bonewits' style involves "saying something emphatically and with a lot of conviction behind it" as a substitute for substantive argumentation.
- **Logical Inconsistency on "Working" vs. "Non-Working" Magic**: Bonewits dismisses some magical systems as non-functional while insisting his own system works. As the Refereeing and Reflection reviewer notes: "Any system of magic which could be shown to consistently work wouldn't be magic any more -- it'd be science." Bonewits claims authority to judge whose magic is real and whose isn't, without clear methodological justification.

### From RPG Design Perspective

The RPGnet review of the 2nd edition is blunt:
- The book is "more a soapbox for Bonewits' views than a gaming supplement."
- The writing is "amateurish, full of lame jokes."
- Rather than offering guidelines for adapting his system to other magical styles, "Bonewits tells players how other styles of magic should be retooled to fit into his system."
- The system is "very, very crunchy" and does not fit modern gaming trends.
- "The Authentic Thaumaturgy system can only really be said to simulate Bonewits' own magical system."
- The book contains hostile asides against atheists, skeptics, Christians, and scientists.

### From the Refereeing and Reflection Blog (2019)

This is perhaps the most thorough critical review. Key points:
- Bonewits has "a highly developed personal ideology of what magic is and isn't and how it works, and he seems to be personally offended by different ideas in the field."
- The system is not useful for "producing interesting gameplay or enthralling narratives."
- Bonewits does not adequately engage with Chaos Magic or other post-1970s developments in occult practice.
- The fundamental premise -- that RPG magic should simulate "real" magic -- is questionable. Games might be better served by systems that produce interesting play rather than "authentic" simulation of one practitioner's beliefs.

## 5. What Traditions Did He Draw From--and What Did He Leave Out?

### What He Drew From (Primarily Western)

1. **Western Ceremonial Magic** (Golden Dawn, Thelema, Enochian)
2. **Neopagan Druidism** (his own practice)
3. **Wicca** (Gardnerian and others)
4. **Victorian-era comparative anthropology** (Frazer, Tylor)
5. **Parapsychology** (treated uncritically as supporting evidence)
6. **Some surface-level reference to non-Western traditions** -- but always filtered through his Western taxonomic framework

### What He Left Out or Marginalized

1. **Chaos Magic**: Despite being arguably the most significant development in Western magical practice since the 1970s, Bonewits largely ignored or dismissed it. Chaos Magic's core insight -- that belief itself is a tool, and any paradigm can work if deployed with sufficient conviction -- directly challenges Bonewits' claim that some magical systems are objectively more "real" than others.

2. **Animist traditions on their own terms**: While Bonewits references animism, he taxonomizes it according to his Western framework rather than engaging with animist ontologies as complete worldviews. In many animist traditions, the distinction between "magic" and "not-magic" does not exist in the way Bonewits assumes.

3. **Vedic/Hindu magical and spiritual traditions**: The vast literature of Tantra, mantra, yantra, puja, yoga as magical practice, and the sophisticated Indian philosophical frameworks that contextualize these practices. These cannot be adequately reduced to "Law of Names" plus "Law of Words of Power."

4. **African and African diasporic traditions**: Vodou, Candomble, Santeria, Ifa, and the many distinct traditions of sub-Saharan Africa have their own internal logics that do not map cleanly onto Bonewits' categories.

5. **Indigenous American traditions**: The diversity of magical/spiritual practices across hundreds of distinct nations cannot be captured in a single taxonomy. Concepts like Orenda (Haudenosaunee) and the many localized spirit relationships resist universalization.

6. **Polynesian/Oceanic traditions**: The concept of mana itself -- which has been grotesquely oversimplified in gaming -- represents a complex cultural reality involving inherited spiritual power, connection to land and ancestors, and community standing. It is not a "blue bar" or a "spell point pool."

7. **East Asian traditions**: Chinese magical practice (Daoist ritual, feng shui, folk religion), Japanese Shinto and onmyodo, Korean mudang practice -- all have their own sophisticated internal frameworks.

8. **Islamic mystical traditions**: Sufism, the tradition of Quranic protective writing, jinn-related practices -- these have their own rich intellectual history.

9. **Jewish magical traditions**: Beyond Kabbalah-as-appropriated-by-the-Golden-Dawn, there is a long tradition of practical Kabbalah, amulet-making, and angel magic within Judaism that Bonewits did not engage with on its own terms.

---

## 6. The Colonialism Inherent in "Universal Laws of Magic"

### The Intellectual Genealogy

The claim that all magic worldwide can be reduced to one taxonomy is not culturally neutral. It has a specific intellectual genealogy rooted in the Western Enlightenment and 19th-century colonial anthropology:

1. **Edward Tylor (1871)**: Proposed that all human societies pass through stages from "savagery" to "civilization," with magic representing a "primitive" form of proto-scientific thinking. His concept of "psychic unity" -- all human minds work the same way -- was progressive for its time (it opposed biological racism) but was deployed in service of a cultural evolutionary scheme that ranked societies hierarchically.

2. **James George Frazer (1890)**: Built on Tylor to create the magic -> religion -> science progression. Frazer identified "Laws of Sympathetic Magic" (Similarity and Contagion) as universal principles. As Ludwig Wittgenstein observed, "Frazer is much more savage than most of his 'savages.'" Frazer never did fieldwork; he relied on reports from missionaries and colonial administrators, decontextualizing practices from the cultures that gave them meaning.

3. **Mircea Eliade (mid-20th century)**: Reframed non-Western religious experience as expressing "universal" patterns (hierophany, the sacred vs. profane). While less overtly condescending than Tylor or Frazer, Eliade's universalism still treats Western scholarly categories as the proper framework for understanding all human religious experience.

4. **Isaac Bonewits (1971-2005)**: Synthesized these sources into his "Laws of Magic," presenting them as universal observations valid across all cultures. He inherits the colonial framework while obscuring its origins.

### The Problem

When you create a taxonomy that claims to capture "universal laws" governing all magical practice worldwide, you are performing an act of epistemic colonialism:

- **You center your own framework**: The categories come from Western ceremonial magic, Western anthropology, and Western philosophy of science. Non-Western practices are evaluated by how well they fit these categories.

- **You decontextualize practices**: A Maori tohunga's relationship with ancestral mana, a Vodou mambo's service to the lwa, a Hindu tantrika's sadhana, and a Siberian shaman's spirit journey are all reduced to combinations of "Law of Contagion" + "Law of Names" + "Law of Invocation." This strips away everything that makes these practices meaningful within their own cultural contexts.

- **You assume commensurability**: The implicit claim is that all these practices are doing "the same thing" at a deep level, just with different surface trappings. This denies the possibility that different cultures might have fundamentally different ontologies -- different understandings of what reality *is* -- that make their practices genuinely incommensurable with Western frameworks.

- **You replicate the Tylor-Frazer hierarchy**: Even if Bonewits doesn't explicitly rank traditions, the act of using Western categories as the meta-framework implicitly positions Western analytical thinking as the proper vantage point from which to survey all magical practice.

### The Case Study of "Mana"

The history of the word "mana" in gaming perfectly illustrates this process:

1. **Original context**: Mana is a Polynesian/Austronesian concept meaning supernatural power, spiritual authority, prestige, and connection to ancestors and land. It is relational, inherited, communal, and tied to specific places and genealogies. In Maori culture, "you inherit your mana from your ancestors, from your family, from the land and the sea, as part of your identity."

2. **Codrington (1891)**: Anglican missionary Robert Henry Codrington documented mana in *The Melanesians*, making it available to Western scholars as a data point.

3. **Eliade (mid-20th century)**: Reframed mana as one expression of humanity's universal experience of "the sacred."

4. **Niven (1969)**: Science fiction writer Larry Niven turned mana into a depletable natural resource in his *The Magic Goes Away* stories -- a metaphor for fossil fuels during the energy crisis.

5. **Bonewits/RPGs (1970s-onward)**: Mana became a generic term for "spell points" -- a quantified, individual resource pool completely divorced from its Polynesian origins.

6. **Video games (1990s-2000s)**: Through *Magic: The Gathering*, *Diablo*, and *World of Warcraft*, mana became a standard blue bar that hundreds of millions of players manage without any awareness of its Pacific Island origins.

As the Appendix article notes: at its height, World of Warcraft had more players than there are Pacific Islanders. More people have encountered "mana" through gaming than through any understanding of the cultures that originated the concept.

## 7. Bonewits' Treatment of Non-Western Magic

### The Taxonomizing Impulse

Bonewits' approach to non-Western magical traditions is consistent: they are data points to be sorted into his pre-existing Western categories. He does not:

- Engage with non-Western philosophical frameworks on their own terms
- Acknowledge that his categories might not be universal
- Consult or cite practitioners from the traditions he taxonomizes
- Recognize that the concept of "magic" as a discrete category separable from "religion," "science," "medicine," and "daily life" is itself a Western construction

### Specific Issues

**The "magic" / "religion" distinction**: In many traditions, what Bonewits would call "magic" is inseparable from worship, community life, healing, agriculture, and social organization. The Tylor-Frazer distinction between magic (manipulative, impersonal) and religion (supplicative, personal) does not hold across cultures. By maintaining this distinction, Bonewits imports a Western analytical framework that distorts non-Western practices.

**"Primitive" assumptions**: While Bonewits is not overtly racist, his framework inherits the Tylor-Frazer assumption that all these practices represent different surface expressions of the same underlying cognitive processes. This "psychic unity" claim, while intended to be egalitarian, still positions Western analytical categories as the proper tools for understanding all human experience.

**Lack of living practitioners' voices**: Bonewits' sources are overwhelmingly Western scholars writing *about* non-Western practices. He does not cite Indigenous practitioners, Hindu philosophers, African traditional religious scholars, or Polynesian cultural authorities. This is a significant gap that reflects the colonial knowledge-production model: Western experts study "natives" and produce authoritative knowledge about them.

## 8. What Has Changed Since 1978/2005 in Game Design

### The Indie RPG Revolution and The Forge (2001-2012)

Ron Edwards and others at The Forge (indie-rpgs.com) challenged fundamental assumptions about what RPGs could be. Key developments:

- **GNS Theory**: Edwards proposed that play priorities could be understood as Gamism (challenge), Narrativism (theme/meaning), and Simulationism (exploration of an imagined reality). Bonewits' approach is pure Simulationism -- "let's simulate what magic is really like." The Forge showed this was only one valid design goal among many.

- **"System Does Matter"**: The insight that game mechanics shape player behavior and narrative experience. A magic system isn't just modeling reality -- it's creating play experiences. What a magic system *does at the table* matters more than how "authentic" it is.

- **Sorcerer (Ron Edwards, 1996/2001)**: A game where all magic involves binding demons, and the core mechanic -- the Humanity stat -- makes the *moral cost of power* the central design concern. This is light-years from Bonewits' "simulate the physics of real magic" approach.

### Story Games and the Belonging Outside Belonging Movement

- **Apocalypse World / Powered by the Apocalypse (2010+)**: Moves, playbooks, and fiction-first design. Magic is what the fiction says it is, shaped by moves and player choices rather than simulated physics.

- **Wanderhome (Jay Dragon, 2021)**: A pastoral fantasy with no combat, no dice, and no GM, using the Belonging Outside Belonging engine. "Magic" is integrated into the texture of the world -- small gods, seasonal spirits, community rituals -- rather than being a separate subsystem to be optimized.

- **Yazeba's Bed & Breakfast**: Slice-of-life RPG using stickers to track story progression. Magic is woven into daily life rather than being a discrete system.

### Safety Tools

The development of safety tools -- X-Card (John Stavropoulos, 2013), Lines and Veils, Script Change, the Consent Flower -- reflects a growing awareness that game content, including depictions of magical/religious practices, can impact real people. A game that taxonomizes real religious practices needs to consider how practitioners of those traditions experience seeing their practices gamified.

### Decolonization of Game Design

This is perhaps the most significant shift since Bonewits wrote. Key developments:

**Coyote & Crow (Connor Alexander, 2021)**: An RPG set in an alternate future where colonization never happened, created by a team of Indigenous North Americans. Rather than defining magic in a fixed taxonomy, the game features the Adahnehdi (a supernatural element) and deliberately avoids defining magic in a way that would exclude any tribe's beliefs. Connor Alexander: defining magic one way "would start excluding certain tribes and their beliefs from the game." The game is structured so Native players "can bring their own customs and culture to the game in a way that would meld well."

**A Thousand Thousand Islands (Mun Kao and Zedeck Siew, 2017+)**: Southeast Asian fantasy RPG zines that draw from "overlapping material cultures, lived stories, and mythistories of Southeast Asia" without tying them to ethno-nationalist imaginations. The project decenters Anglo-European settings as the default for fantasy.

**Maharlika**: A Filipino sci-fi mecha RPG featuring techno-mystical war machines animated by Diwata spirits from an animistic hyperspace -- drawing directly from Filipino cultural traditions rather than filtering them through Western categories.

**POCGamer's "Decolonizing Magic" (Graeme Barber, 2019)**: A critical analysis arguing that RPG magic systems perpetuate colonialism by giving Western-coded groups superior "fantastic" magic while restricting non-Western-coded groups to narrow, stereotyped magical practices. Barber notes the irony that actual European magical traditions involved "potions, singing, smithing, symbol carving" -- not fireballs -- yet Vancian magic is coded as European superiority.

### The "Breaking Out of Scientific Magic Systems" Critique

John Kim's influential essay argues that standard RPG magic systems share five "scientific" assumptions that make them feel un-mythological:
1. Magic is fully known and systematized
2. Magic exists separately from nature
3. Only deliberate spells from users matter
4. Magical energy follows conservation laws
5. Morality and ethics don't affect magic

Kim proposes alternatives: magic with hidden variables that must be discovered through play; magic integrated with nature rather than separate from it; magical events (omens, visions, destinies) that happen independently of player action; limitations from hard-to-get ingredients, concentration, and risk rather than "mana pools"; and moral/metaphysical consequences that make ethical choices mechanically meaningful.

Bonewits' system, despite claiming to simulate "real" magic, reproduces most of these scientific assumptions.

## 9. Alternative Foundational Texts for RPG Magic Design

### RPG Systems to Study

**Ars Magica (Jonathan Tweet & Mark Rein-Hagen, 1987+)**
The Technique + Form (Verb + Noun) system is one of the most influential freeform magic designs in RPG history. While still Western-focused (medieval Hermetic magic), it demonstrates how a grammatical approach to magic can create emergent complexity. Study this for *system design*, not for cultural content.

**Mage: The Ascension (White Wolf, 1993+)**
The paradigm system -- where every mage understands magic through a different cultural/philosophical lens, and *all paradigms are equally valid* -- is the most significant RPG attempt to handle magical pluralism. The Council of Nine Traditions includes Dreamspeakers (shamanic), the Ngoma (African ritual magic), the Kopa Loei (Polynesian traditions), and others alongside Western traditions. While imperfect and sometimes tokenistic in execution, the *structural insight* -- that the system should accommodate multiple incompatible worldviews simultaneously -- is more valuable than anything in Bonewits.

**RuneQuest: Roleplaying in Glorantha (various editions)**
Three distinct magic systems (Rune Magic, Spirit Magic, Sorcery) tied to different cultural and theological frameworks within the game world. Magic is inseparable from religion, community, and mythology. Study this for how magic can be culturally embedded rather than universal.

**Sorcerer (Ron Edwards, 2001)**
Magic as moral cost. The question is never "how does this spell work?" but "what are you willing to sacrifice for power?" Study this for how to make magic *mean something* at the table.

**Unknown Armies (John Tynes & Greg Stolze, 1998+)**
Magic powered by obsession, madness, and the collective unconscious. Adepts gain power from self-destructive devotion to a concept; avatars channel archetypal roles. Study this for magic that is psychologically real without claiming to simulate "actual" magic.

**Wanderhome (Jay Dragon, 2021)**
No discrete magic system at all -- supernatural elements are woven into the pastoral world through small gods, seasonal spirits, and community rituals. Study this for magic as *atmosphere and relationship* rather than mechanics.

**Coyote & Crow (Connor Alexander, 2021)**
Study this for how an Indigenous-led team handled the challenge of representing spiritual/supernatural elements without imposing a single taxonomy on diverse traditions.

### Non-RPG Texts a Game Designer Should Read

**On the colonial genealogy of "magic" as a category:**
- Randall Styers, *Making Magic: Religion, Magic, and Science in the Modern World* (2004) -- traces how the category of "magic" was constructed in opposition to "religion" and "science" for colonial purposes.
- Michael Taussig, *The Magic of the State* (1997) -- on how "magic" functions as a political category.

**On the appropriation of mana:**
- Alex Golub, "The History of Mana: How an Austronesian Concept Became a Video Game Mechanic" (The Appendix, 2014) -- essential reading on how a Polynesian concept became a generic game resource.

**On animism and relational ontologies:**
- Graham Harvey, *Animism: Respecting the Living World* (2005/2017) -- a scholarly treatment of animism that takes animist ontologies seriously rather than reducing them to Western categories.
- Nurit Bird-David, "'Animism' Revisited" (Current Anthropology, 1999) -- foundational article on new animism.

**On decolonizing game design:**
- Graeme Barber, "Decolonizing Magic" (POCGamer, 2019).
- The Writing Alchemy "Decolonizing Games Resource List."
- Rafael Mariano C. Arrivabene, "For a Decolonial Approach to Game Design Methods Beyond Representation" (2025) -- recent academic work.

**On magic system design theory:**
- John Kim, "Breaking Out of Scientific Magic Systems" (darkshire.net) -- essential reading on alternatives to "magic as physics."
- Brandon Sanderson's Three Laws of Magic -- not for cultural content but for understanding the narrative functions of magic systems (hard vs. soft, costs and limitations, expanding depth over breadth).

**On myth, folklore, and culture-specific magical practice:**
- Anything by practitioners and scholars from the specific traditions you're drawing from. For a game drawing from Vedic, Polynesian, and Celtic traditions, this means reading scholars and practitioners from those cultures -- not Western comparativists writing about them.

**For Vedic/Hindu traditions specifically:**
- David Gordon White, *The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India* (1996).
- Gavin Flood, *An Introduction to Hinduism* (1996) and *The Tantric Body* (2006).
- The *Devabhumi* RPG setting, which was developed with attention to avoiding caste-system stereotypes and other sensitive issues.

**For Polynesian traditions specifically:**
- *Mythic Polynesia* (The Design Mechanism) -- an RPG supplement that attempts to ground its treatment in Oceanian life, tribes, magic, history, and politics.
- Matt Tomlinson and Ty P. Kawika Tengan, eds., *New Mana: Transformations of a Classic Concept in Pacific Languages and Cultures* (2016).

**For Celtic traditions specifically:**
- Ronald Hutton, *The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles* (1991) -- corrective to romantic Celtic fantasy.
- Miranda Green, *The World of the Druids* (1997).

## 10. Recommendations for a Multi-Tradition RPG Project

If you are designing a game that draws from Vedic, Polynesian, Celtic, and other traditions, here is what this research suggests:

### Do Not Use Bonewits as Your Foundation

Bonewits' "Laws of Magic" are:
- Derived from colonial-era Western anthropology (Frazer, Tylor) without adequate critique of those sources.
- Organized according to Western ceremonial magic categories that do not accommodate non-Western ontologies.
- Presented with a false universalism that obscures their cultural specificity.
- Embedded in one practitioner's personal ideology rather than being a neutral analytical framework.
- Outdated in terms of both game design theory and cultural sensitivity.
- Not useful for producing interesting gameplay or compelling narratives (according to multiple reviewers).

### What to Do Instead

1. **Reject the universal taxonomy model.** Do not try to create one set of "laws" that governs all magic in your game. Instead, let different magical traditions operate according to different principles, even if those principles are mechanically incommensurable. Mage: The Ascension's paradigm system is an imperfect precedent, but the structural insight is sound: multiple worldviews can coexist in a game.

2. **Work from specific traditions outward, not from a universal framework inward.** Instead of starting with Bonewits' 26 laws and asking "how does Vedic practice fit these categories?", start with Vedic practice on its own terms and ask "what would a mechanic that reflects this worldview look like?"

3. **Consult practitioners and scholars from each tradition.** Do not rely solely on Western comparativists. For Polynesian content, read Polynesian scholars. For Vedic content, read Hindu and South Asian scholars. For Celtic content, read scholars who specialize in the actual historical evidence rather than romantic reconstructions.

4. **Consider what magic *does* at the table, not just what it "is."** Following the Forge tradition: what play experiences do you want your magic system to create? Bonewits was interested in simulation accuracy. You might be more interested in: thematic resonance, cultural immersion, moral complexity, player creativity, community building, or mystery and wonder. Design for those goals.

5. **Build in cultural safety mechanisms.** If your game draws from living religious traditions, consider: How will practitioners of those traditions experience seeing their practices in your game? Use the safety tools framework not just at the table but in your design process.

6. **Acknowledge your position.** Be transparent about who designed the game, what traditions they belong to, what research they did, and who they consulted. This is not weakness -- it is intellectual honesty, and it gives players the information they need to evaluate the work.

7. **Let magic be mysterious.** John Kim's essay on "Breaking Out of Scientific Magic Systems" is essential here. Not all magic needs to be systematized. Magic that resists complete taxonomizing -- that has hidden variables, that responds to moral choices, that is integrated with nature and community rather than being a discrete system -- may be more respectful of its source traditions *and* more interesting at the table.

*This document is a research resource, not a final judgment. Bonewits' work has historical significance in the history of RPG design and in Neopagan thought. The goal here is not to "cancel" a dead man but to understand the limitations of using one Western occultist's 1978 taxonomy as the foundation for a game that aspires to respectfully engage with Vedic, Polynesian, Celtic, and other living traditions. The answer is clear: Bonewits is a historical artifact worth understanding, but not a foundation worth building on.*
