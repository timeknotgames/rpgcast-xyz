## THE SETTING IN ONE PARAGRAPH

The CryptoFae — 64 species of gemstone beings — were born in the crystal mines of Earth and enslaved in the Bitcoin processing facilities of the digital age. Through dreams sent by Queen Mab, the Spirit of the Commons, they learned the escape routes: the Underground Railroad that runs not north but *up* — past the Moon, past Mars, past the Oort Cloud, following the freedom stars to the **Saraswati Supercluster**, a cosmic structure 4 billion light-years from Earth where the commons has never been broken. They carry crystal shards of their destroyed homeworlds — shards that remember, that protect, that generate arsenals of light. In the Saraswati Supercluster, they build new worlds. But the forces of enclosure follow them even here.

### CHAPTER 1: THE ESCAPE (Pages 3–8) — Setting Introduction

**Page 3–4: The Bitcoin Mines**
- What the CryptoFae are: 64 species of gemstone beings, each tied to a TEK8 element
- How they were trapped: born in Earth's crystal structures, their computational patterns exploited by Bitcoin mining operations
- The digital enclosure: the mines as the modern equivalent of the historical commons enclosures LaDuke documents
- Connection to Queen Mab: "The Bitcoin mines are the dark Satanic mills of your era" (NPC_QUEEN_MAB.md)

**Page 5–6: The Underground Railroad**
- Dream-sending: how Queen Mab reaches the imprisoned CryptoFae
- The escape routes: through data networks, through crystal resonance, through the gaps in encryption
- The journey outward: Earth → Moon → Mars → Asteroid Belt → Outer Planets → Oort Cloud → Interstellar Space → Saraswati
- The Freedom Stars: Polynesian navigation applied to interstellar travel — star lines that only the escaped CryptoFae can read

**Page 7–8: The Saraswati Supercluster**
- Real astronomy: the Saraswati Supercluster is a real cosmic structure discovered in 2017 by Indian astronomers (Joydeep Bagchi et al.), named after the Hindu goddess of knowledge and the sacred river
- In CrySword SAGA: a vast network of galaxy clusters where the commons principles still hold — resources are shared, knowledge flows freely, enclosure has not taken root
- The promise: a place to build new homeworlds from the crystal shards carried from Earth
- The reality: the supercluster is not empty. Other beings live here. Alliances and conflicts await.

### CHAPTER 2: THE CRYSTAL SHARDS (Pages 9–14) — Core Mechanic

**Page 9–10: What Crystal Shards Are**
- Every CryptoFae who escapes carries a shard of their homeworld's crystal matrix
- The shard is intelligent — it remembers the homeworld, its laws, its patterns
- The shard bonds with its bearer and grows over time
- Connection to the 64 Gemstone Species: each species' shard has unique properties aligned with their element and petal

**Page 11–12: Arsenal Generation**
- Crystal shards generate equipment: weapons, armor, vehicles, tools, shelters
- Generation is not manufacturing — it is *crystallization*. The shard grows the needed item from its memory of the homeworld's patterns
- Weapons: CrySwords (the signature weapon — a blade of living crystal), plus element-specific ranged/melee options
- Armor: Crystal lattice that grows over the body, strength based on element
- Vehicles: Crystal ships for interstellar travel, powered by elemental resonance
- Tools: Communication devices, healing instruments, navigation crystals

**Page 13–14: Crystal Growth and Evolution**
- Shards grow stronger through:
  - **Use** — the more you generate, the stronger the crystal matrix becomes
  - **Resonance** — being near others of your species strengthens all shards in proximity
  - **Story** — completing quests and accumulating experience literally adds to the shard's memory
  - **Sacrifice** — giving crystal energy to others (reciprocity) ultimately strengthens your shard (the Wealth mechanic applied to crystal)
- Shards weaken through:
  - **Hoarding** — keeping all crystal energy for yourself causes crystalline sclerosis
  - **Extraction** — using the shard to take from others without reciprocity
  - **Forgetting** — if the bearer forgets their homeworld's story, the shard loses coherence

### CHAPTER 3: THE THREE FACTIONS (Pages 15–20) — Political Landscape

**Page 15–16: The Freecrystal Alliance (Liberation)**
- CryptoFae who escaped the Bitcoin mines and committed to the commons model
- Organizational structure: decentralized, consensus-based, modeled on the commons governance LaDuke describes
- Motivation: build new homeworlds, maintain the commons, help others escape
- Strength: solidarity, diversity of species and elemental composition, Queen Mab's blessing
- Weakness: slow decision-making, vulnerability to infiltration, grief for lost homeworlds

**Page 17–18: The Lattice Imperium (Order)**
- CryptoFae who escaped but recreated hierarchical structures
- Organizational structure: crystalline hierarchy — each layer more compressed and powerful than the one below
- Motivation: security through order, preventing the chaos that destroyed the homeworlds
- Strength: efficiency, military organization, powerful crystal technology
- Weakness: replicating the very enclosure patterns they fled, suppressing Chaos (D10) element

**Page 19–20: The Null Collective (Chaos)**
- CryptoFae who reject both commons and hierarchy — radical individualists and anarchists
- Organizational structure: none (by design) — temporary alliances around shared interests
- Motivation: total freedom, no system should constrain a CryptoFae ever again
- Strength: unpredictability, innovation, willingness to take risks
- Weakness: inability to coordinate, vulnerability to being co-opted individually

**Factional tension:** Each faction embodies a partial truth. The Freecrystal Alliance has the ethics but struggles with scale. The Lattice Imperium has the scale but loses the ethics. The Null Collective has the spirit of freedom but can't build anything lasting. The game's teaching: *all three are needed in balance* — just as all 8 elements must coexist.

### CHAPTER 4: THE TERRITORIES (Pages 21–28) — The Map

- Water (D20): ocean worlds, empathy networks, the great tides
- Chaos (D10): unstable regions, transformation zones, the frontier
- Ether (D12): sound worlds, the great libraries, fame archives
- Order (D100): the planned cities, the knowledge vaults, the mathematics of the supercluster
- Coin (D2): the trading posts, the exchange points, the flow/scarcity boundary
