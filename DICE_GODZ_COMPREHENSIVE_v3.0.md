# CHAPTER 1: FOUNDATIONAL PHILOSOPHY

## 1.1 The Three Truths

**Truth 1: Magic Is a Process, Not a Thing.**
In Dice Godz, a spell is never a button press. It is a series of deliberate actions — gathering knowledge, raising mana, applying Laws of Magic, shaping energy through Psychic Talents, and releasing it toward a goal. No two castings are identical because the caster's state, the environment, and the target all vary.

**Truth 2: Mana Comes from Somewhere and Goes Somewhere.**
There is no free magic. Every spell costs energy (Mana Points, or MPs). That energy comes from the caster's body, the surrounding ether, a magical device, a willing donor, a forced victim, a deity, or the land itself. Energy must be raised before it can be shaped. This is the TANSTAAFL Principle — There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch.

**Truth 3: The Mind Controls All Magic.**
Anything that affects the mind affects magical ability. Fear, confidence, intoxication, distraction, meditation, ecstasy, and pain all modify spellcasting. The Catalyst Effect means that a small amount of energy, precisely focused by a prepared mind, produces results far beyond what raw power alone could achieve.

## 1.2 The Dice Godz Difference

What sets Dice Godz apart from other fantasy RPG magic systems:

| Conventional RPG | Dice Godz v3.0 |
|---|---|
| Spell slots that refresh after rest | Mana Points generated daily, drawn from 6+ sources |
| Spells as menu items | Spells as constructed processes using Laws and Talents |
| One type of wizard | 12+ magical modalities (Mage, Shaman, Cleric, Druid, Witch, etc.) |
| Magic items are permanent | Enchantments decay; items have half-lives |
| Gods as stat blocks | Gods as living mana ecosystems that grow/shrink with worship |
| No environmental variation | Mana Density zones, Ley-Lines, and Sacred Sites |
| Binary success/fail | Four failure types (Minor, Major, Disastrous, Total) |
| Physical combat is separate from magical combat | Unified 360-degree crystal arena |
| Game world is separate from real world | IRL garden system maps TEK8 elements to actual planting |

## 1.3 The Eight-Fold Path

The TEK8 system organizes all of reality into eight elemental forces. These are not arbitrary categories — they emerge from the interaction of three axes:

- **Physical ↔ Spiritual** (Matter vs. Mind)
- **Active ↔ Passive** (Yang vs. Yin)
- **Individual ↔ Collective** (Self vs. All)

The eight elements are the vertices of this cube of existence:

```
      FIRE ←─── Active/Physical/Individual
      EARTH ←── Passive/Physical/Individual
      WATER ←── Passive/Physical/Collective
      AIR ←──── Active/Spiritual/Individual
      COIN ←─── Active/Physical/Collective
      CHAOS ←── Active/Spiritual/Collective
      ETHER ←── Passive/Spiritual/Individual
      ORDER ←── Passive/Spiritual/Collective
```

# CHAPTER 2: THE TEK8 ELEMENTAL SYSTEM

## 2.1 The Eight Guilds

| Element | Die | Color | Guild | Domain | Mana Flavor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fire** | D4 | Red | Smiths & Tinkerers | Creation, forge, transformation, courage | Hot, sharp, urgent |
| **Earth** | D6 | Green | Grounders & Growers | Stability, nurture, growth, patience | Slow, heavy, nourishing |
| **Water** | D20 | Blue | Storykeepers & Healers | Memory, healing, flow, empathy | Cool, deep, cleansing |
| **Air** | D8 | Cyan | Translators & Teachers | Knowledge, communication, clarity | Light, quick, transparent |
| **Coin** | D2 | Yellow | Weavers & Distributors | Exchange, charge, networking, value | Electric, buzzing, connective |
| **Chaos** | D10 | Orange | Tricksters & Remixers | Change, surprise, mutation, freedom | Shifting, unpredictable, vivid |
| **Ether** | D12 | Purple | Sonic Assemblers | Spirit, vibration, transcendence, dream | Resonant, humming, expansive |
| **Order** | D100 | Indigo | Archivists & Codemakers | Structure, law, precision, record | Crystalline, measured, ancient |

## 2.2 The Creation Cycle

Elements feed each other in a cycle:

```
Fire → Earth → Water → Air → Fire (clockwise)
```

**Fire feeds Earth:** The forge makes tools; volcanic soil is richest.
**Earth feeds Water:** Mountains birth rivers; minerals give water its character.
**Water feeds Air:** Evaporation creates clouds; humidity carries scent.
**Air feeds Fire:** Oxygen fuels combustion; wind spreads flame.

The **secondary cycle** links the remaining four:

```
Coin → Chaos → Ether → Order → Coin
```

**Coin feeds Chaos:** Investment enables experimentation.
**Chaos feeds Ether:** Mutations open spiritual pathways.
**Ether feeds Order:** Revelation becomes codified law.
**Order feeds Coin:** Structure enables reliable exchange.

## 2.3 The Opposition Axes

Each element has a polar opposite:

| Axis | Opposition | Tension |
|---|---|---|
| Fire ↔ Water | Transformation vs. Preservation | The forge vs. the river |
| Earth ↔ Air | Weight vs. Weightlessness | Root vs. wing |
| Coin ↔ Ether | Material value vs. Spiritual value | Gold vs. prayer |
| Chaos ↔ Order | Mutation vs. Structure | Wildfire vs. crystal |

Opposing elements are hardest to combine in spells but produce the most dramatic results when synthesized (the **Law of Synthesis**).

## 2.4 Mana Density by Element

Each TEK8 element has locations of concentrated mana:

| Element | High Mana Zones | Very High Mana Zones | Wild Mana (Faerie) Zones |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fire | Volcanic regions, forges, battlefields | Active calderas, dragon lairs | Realm of Salamanders |
| Earth | Ancient forests, caves, mountain roots | Crystal caverns, megaliths | Realm of Gnomes |
| Water | Deep oceans, sacred springs, rain | Underwater trenches, tidal nexuses | Realm of Undines |
| Air | Mountain peaks, open sky, storms | Lightning strikes, eye of hurricane | Realm of Sylphs |
| Coin | Trade routes, markets, mining veins | Ley-line crossroads, bank vaults | — |
| Chaos | Fault lines, trickster shrines, crossroads | Anomaly zones, dimensional thin spots | Faerie proper |
| Ether | Temples, meditation caves, song lines | Astral convergence points | Astral Plane |
| Order | Libraries, courthouses, observatories | Akashic Archive nodes | Crystal Lattice |

# CHAPTER 3: CHARACTER CREATION — THE GODZ WORLD EGG

## 3.1 Overview

Character creation in Dice Godz uses the **Godz World Egg (GWE)** — a 360-degree dice-rolling process that determines the elemental composition of your character's soul.

## 3.2 Step 1: Choose Crystal School

Your Crystal School is your primary elemental affinity — the guild you train with. This determines:
- Your starting **Magical Modality** (see Chapter 5)
- Your primary **Elemental Die**
- Your starting **Gemstone Species** pool

| Crystal School | Modality Options | Starting Die |
|---|---|---|
| Fire | Magician, War Witch, Smith-Mage | D4 |
| Earth | Druid, Medicine Person, Herbalist | D6 |
| Water | Healer, Medium, Sea-Shaman | D20 |
| Air | Wizard, Teacher, Bard | D8 |
| Coin | Merchant-Mage, Techno-Mage, Goetic | D2 |
| Chaos | Trickster, Wild Witch, Psychic | D10 |
| Ether | Mystic, Cleric, Sonic Assembler | D12 |
| Order | Archivist, Ceremonial Magician, Judge | D100 |

## 3.3 Step 2: Roll the Godz World Egg (360-Degree Dice)

Roll all 8 TEK8 dice simultaneously. Each die result maps to a degree arc of the 360-degree wheel. The resulting percentages determine your **Elemental Composition**.

```
FIRE:   D4  → result × 90°  → max 360° arc
EARTH:  D6  → result × 60°
WATER:  D20 → result × 18°
AIR:    D8  → result × 45°
COIN:   D2  → result × 180°
CHAOS:  D10 → result × 36°
ETHER:  D12 → result × 30°
ORDER:  D100 → result × 3.6°
```

Normalize all results to percentages summing to 100%. The highest percentage is your **Primary Element**; the lowest is your **Shadow Element**.

## 3.4 Step 3: Determine Psi Potential

**Psi Potential (PR)** measures the subtlety of your character's nervous system and determines which Psychic Talents are available.

Roll 3D6 for base Psi Potential (range 3-18).

**Modifiers:**
- Primary Element Ether: +2
- Primary Element Air: +1
- Primary Element Chaos: +1
- Primary Element Order: -1 (structured mind, less intuitive psi)
- Crystal School bonus: +1 if school matches Primary Element

**PR determines talent breadth** — how many Psychic Talents from the Talent Pool you receive (see Chapter 5).

## 3.5 Step 4: Derive Core Stats

| Stat | Derivation | AT Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Psi Potential (PR)** | 3D6 + modifiers | AT Ch.5 |
| **Intelligence (INT)** | 3D6 | Standard |
| **Wisdom (WIS)** | 3D6 | Standard |
| **Strength (STR)** | 3D6 | Standard |
| **Constitution (CON)** | 3D6 | Standard |
| **Ego (EGO)** | 3D6 | AT Ch.5 — willpower/selfhood |
| **Piety (PIE)** | 3D6 | AT Ch.5 — divine connection strength |
| **Charisma (CHA)** | 3D6 | Standard |
| **Dexterity (DEX)** | 3D6 | Standard |
| **Perception (PER)** | 3D6 | Standard |

## 3.6 Step 5: Calculate Magical Statistics

From AT Formulas 5.1 and 5.2:

**Magical Strength (MSTR)** = (10^Rank × (PIE + INT + STR + CON) / 4) + Sum of Magical Stat Adjustments from Talents

*Magical Strength is the maximum Mana Points generated per day from your own body.*

**Magical Power (MPOW)** = 10% × Magical Strength

*Magical Power is the maximum Mana Points you can channel into a single spell.*

**Magical Clarity Limit (MCL):**

| Rank | MCL |
|---|---|
| 0 (untrained) | 15% |
| 1 (Apprentice) | 25-50% |
| 2 (Journeyman) | 45-70% |
| 3 (Master) | 60-85% |
| 4 (Magus) | 75-95% |
| 5 (Adept) | 90-99% |

**Magical Luck Limit (MLL):**

| Rank | MLL |
|---|---|
| 0 | 50% |
| 1 | 80% |
| 2 | 75% |
| 3 | 85% |
| 4 | 95% |
| 5 | 99% |

*Note: Rank 2 MLL (75%) is lower than Rank 1 (80%) because Journeymen attempt more complex magic. The dip represents the "sophomore slump" where ambition outpaces mastery.*

## 3.7 Step 6: Receive Starter Gemstone Species

Your highest-percentage element from the GWE roll determines which gemstone pool you draw from. Roll 1D8 (or choose with GM approval) from that petal's eight species.

**Gemstone Species Bonus:** Your starter gemstone grants:
- **Defense** = Mohs Hardness value
- **Stability** = Crystal System mapping (Cubic=10, Hex=8, Trig=7, Ortho=6, Tetra=5, Mono=4, Tri=3, Amorphous=2)
- **Elemental bonuses** from special properties (piezoelectric=+3 Coin, pleochroic=+2 Chaos, fluorescent=+2 Ether)
- **Kala Affinity** = link to one of the 64 traditional arts (+10% bonus, ×2 XP)
- **Custom Ability** = one species-specific magical ability

## 3.8 Step 7: Hatch Garu Egg

Roll or choose a Garu Egg (0-64). The Egg hatches and bonds with your Gemstone Species, creating a **CryptoFae companion** whose evolution path follows the gemstone's petal.

## 3.9 Step 8: Enter Phenomenon (Starting Zone)

Your Gemstone Species' native habitat becomes your starting Phenomenon on the Rainbow Roads. You begin play in this terrain, with local mana density favoring your element.

# CHAPTER 4: THE 64 GEMSTONE SPECIES

## 4.1 Overview

The 64 Gemstone Species are the living minerals of the Dice Godz world. Each species is a unique combination of mineral science, cultural resonance, and magical potential distributed across the 8 TEK8 elemental petals (8 per petal).

*For complete species descriptions and resonances, see: `DICE_GODZ_64_GEMSTONE_SPECIES_v1.0.md`*
*For modular architecture and governance, see: `DICE_GODZ_MODULAR_SPECIES_FRAMEWORK_v1.0.md`*

## 4.2 Species Distribution

```
FIRE (D4):   Ruby · Garnet · Carnelian · Fire Opal · Sunstone · Red Jasper · Pyrite · Spinel
EARTH (D6):  Emerald · Jade · Malachite · Peridot · Moss Agate · Green Aventurine · Serpentine · Unakite
WATER (D20):  Aquamarine · Lapis Lazuli · Larimar · Pearl · Moonstone · Chrysocolla · Blue Lace Agate · Turquoise
AIR (D8):    Clear Quartz · Fluorite · Celestite · Blue Topaz · Sodalite · Kyanite · Selenite · Apophyllite
COIN (D2):   Citrine · Tiger's Eye · Amber · Yellow Topaz · Rutilated Quartz · Heliodor · Yellow Sapphire · Chrysoberyl
CHAOS (D10): Opal · Labradorite · Alexandrite · Bismuth · Ametrine · Bornite · Watermelon Tourmaline · Sphalerite
ETHER (D12): Amethyst · Sugilite · Charoite · Lepidolite · Tanzanite · Kunzite · Spirit Quartz · Iolite
ORDER (D100): Diamond · Sapphire · Obsidian · Hematite · Onyx · Black Tourmaline · Azurite · Shungite
```

## 4.3 The Three Layers

Every species has three layers (per the Modular Framework):

**Layer 1: Mineral Identity (Fixed)** — Chemical formula, Mohs hardness, crystal system, formation type. This is scientific truth and never changes.

**Layer 2: Elemental Placement (Community-Adjustable)** — Which petal, which position, boundary species status. Changes require documented support from at least 2 Genesis Council perspectives.

**Layer 3: Cultural Resonance (Player-Customizable)** — Name, story, tradition, healing properties, lineage. Players always add; never delete.

## 4.4 Boundary Species

Seven species can legitimately occupy alternative petals:

| Stone | Default Petal | Alternative(s) | Tradition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Turquoise | Water (D20) | Air (D8) | Pueblo/Diné: sky stone |
| Obsidian | Order (D100) | Fire (D4), Chaos (D10) | Mexica: volcanic; Geology: glass |
| Emerald | Earth (D6) | Air (D8) | Jyotish: Mercury's gem |
| Diamond | Order (D100) | Coin (D2), Ether (D12) | Jyotish: Venus; Sanskrit: Vajra |
| Selenite | Air (D8) | Earth (D6), Water (D20) | Agriculture: gypsum |
| Amethyst | Ether (D12) | Earth (D6) | Hildegard: cold/dry humour |
| Chrysoberyl | Coin (D2) | Ether (D12) | Jyotish: Ketu (liberation) |

## 4.5 The 64-Fold Symmetry

The number 64 connects four systems in 1:1 mapping:

| System | Connection |
|---|---|
| **64 Kalas** (Traditional Arts/Skills) | Each species grants affinity to one Kala |
| **64 Garu Eggs** (Companion Identity) | Each egg bonds with one species |
| **64 Phenomena** (Terrain/Habitat) | Each phenomenon is where one species forms |
| **64 Custom Skill Slots** | Each species grants one unique magical ability |

## 4.6 Species Rarity

| Rarity | Real-World Basis | Count | Discovery Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Common** | Abundant globally | 24 | Territory Exploration (Easy) |
| **Uncommon** | Regionally abundant | 20 | Deep Mining (Medium) |
| **Rare** | Few known sources | 12 | Elemental Convergence (Hard) |
| **Legendary** | Exceptional specimens | 8 | Champion Sessions or Garden Growing |

# CHAPTER 5: PSYCHIC TALENTS & MAGICAL MODALITIES

## 5.1 The Four Categories

All magical effects in Dice Godz emerge from four categories of Psychic Talent. These are the *engines* of magic — the Laws of Magic (Chapter 6) are the *tuning*, and mana (Chapter 7) is the *fuel*.

### ESP (Extrasensory Perception) — Receiving Information

| Talent | Description | Base MP Cost | Elemental Affinity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Telepathic Sending | Project thoughts into another mind | 03 | Air |
| Telepathic Receiving | Read thoughts from another mind | 03 | Water |
| Empathy | Sense emotions | 04 | Water |
| Mesmerism | Hypnotic suggestion backed by psi | 07+ (1 MP per INT+EGO of target) | Ether |
| Clairvoyance | See remotely without eyes | 04 | Air |
| Clairaudience | Hear remotely without ears | 04 | Air |
| Clairtangency | Touch remotely | 04 | Earth |
| Clairgustance | Taste remotely | 04 | Water |
| Clairolfaction | Smell remotely | 04 | Air |
| Psychometry | Read object history through touch | 03 | Earth/Order |
| Astral Projection | Project consciousness out of body | 05 | Ether |
| Mental Projection | Project astral body visually | 05+ | Ether |

### Hypercognition — Processing Information

| Talent | Description | Base MP Cost | Elemental Affinity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Retrocognition | Know past events psychically | 07 | Order |
| Hypercognition | Superfast subconscious processing ("hunches") | 05 | Air |
| Precognition | Know future probabilities | 07 | Chaos |

### PK (Psychokinesis) — Moving Matter/Energy

| Talent | Description | Base MP Cost | Elemental Affinity |
|---|---|---|---|
| PK-Proper | Move objects with mind | 07 | Earth |
| Levitation | Defy gravity on objects/self | 07 | Air |
| Apportation | Teleport objects | 15 | Chaos |
| Teleportation | Teleport self | 30 | Chaos |
| CPK (Cellular PK) | Heal/harm at cellular level | Special | Water/Earth |
| Mass Control | Alter mass | 10 | Earth |
| Gravity Control | Alter gravity locally | 10 | Order |
| Density Control | Alter density | 10 | Earth |
| Magnetic Control | Control magnetism | 07 | Coin |
| Electric Control | Control electricity | 07 | Coin |
| Light Control | Control photons | 07 | Fire |
| Heat Control | Control temperature (hot) | 07 | Fire |
| Cold Control | Control temperature (cold) | 07 | Water |
| Radiation Control | Control radioactive decay | 07 | Order |
| Bonding Control | Alter molecular bonds | 05 | Order/Earth |
| Transmutation | Change elemental composition | 15 | Chaos |
| Klutzokinesis | Clumsy PK (uncontrolled coordination) | — | Chaos |

### Anti-Psi — Defending Against Magic

| Talent | Description | Base MP Cost | Elemental Affinity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Catapsi | Generate psychic static (disrupts all psi in range) | 03 | Chaos |
| Splodging | Overwhelm psi fields with emotional broadcast | 03 | Fire |
| Apopsi | Create psi-proof bubble (nothing in or out) | 05 | Order |
| Deflection | Redirect incoming spells (vector change) | 05 | Air |
| Reddopsi | Return spells to sender | 07 | Order |
| Negapsi | Reverse meaning of incoming energy | 04 | Chaos |
| Filtering | Selectively pass/block psi energy content | 05 | Water |
| Retuning | Change the flavor/type of incoming energy | 05 | Ether |
| Damping | Reduce power level of incoming energy (÷10) | 05 | Earth |
| Amplifying | Increase power level of incoming energy (×10) | 05 | Fire |
| Flair | Natural aptitude bonus (passive; no activation cost) | 00 | Any |

## 5.2 Flaired Talents

When a character receives a Psychic Talent, it may be **Flaired** (marked with *). Flaired talents gain a permanent +10% probability increment bonus, representing natural aptitude. Flair is determined at character creation and cannot be trained.

## 5.3 Raw Talent Use vs. Full Spell Use

| Mode | Speed | Reliability | Requirements | When Used |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Raw Talent Use** | Fast (10^(2-r) minutes) | Low (probability from Table 8.1 only) | Just the talent | Emergencies, instinctive reactions |
| **Full Spell Use** | Slow (condensable with practice) | High (cumulative PoSS from all Laws/Talents) | Talent + Laws + Props + Ritual | Planned actions, prepared magic |

**Raw Talent Use** is quick and dirty — using a Psychic Talent without ritual, Laws, or props. It's fast but unreliable. An Apprentice takes 100 minutes for a Raw use; a Journeyman takes 10 minutes; an Adept takes 0.6 seconds.

**Full Spell Use** is the complete process: gathering props, invoking Laws, raising mana, and focusing through talents. It takes longer but is vastly more reliable.

## 5.4 Magical Modalities

Modalities are *cultural packaging* around the same underlying Psychic Talents. A Shaman and a Ceremonial Magician may use the same talents but with completely different props, techniques, and cosmologies.

| Modality | Emphasis | Mana-Raising Technique | Deity Relationship | TEK8 Affinity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Magician** | Active talents; practical results | Visual (mandalas), Auditory (incantations) | Optional (Invocation) | Any |
| **Mystic** | Passive talents; spiritual growth | Meditation, Asceticism | Deep (Identification) | Ether |
| **Cleric** (Prophet) | Active/Passive; divine service | Worship rituals, Congregation | Central (Tapping from deity) | Ether/Order |
| **Cleric** (Exorcist) | Anti-Psi; spirit removal | Invocation, Holy Names | Central | Order |
| **Cleric** (Preacher) | Mesmerism; crowd influence | Auditory (sermons, chants) | Central | Air/Fire |
| **Druid** | Nature magic; knowledge/justice | Earth rituals, sacred groves | Reciprocal (nature deities) | Earth/Air |
| **Ovate** | Divination; healing | Meditation, herbal biochemistry | Reciprocal | Water/Earth |
| **Bard** | Words of Power; performance magic | Music, poetry, story | Light (Invocation) | Air/Chaos |
| **Psychic** | Strong innate talents, minimal training | Emotional intensity, stress | None/Minimal | Chaos |
| **Goetic Magician** | Spirit summoning; ceremonial | Elaborate ritual, Names | Transactional (Evocation) | Order/Coin |
| **Medium** | Spirit communication; channeling | Trance, seance | Possessed by spirits | Ether/Water |
| **Necromancer** | Death magic; ancestor work | Blood, bone, graveyard earth | Ancestral spirits | Water/Order |
| **Medicine Person** | Tribal healer/magician; practical | Dance, drumming, herbs, sweat lodge | Reciprocal (tribal deities, totems) | Earth/Fire |
| **Shaman** | Astral traveler; spirit walker | Drumming, trance, OOBEs | Deep (possession by helping spirits) | Ether/Chaos |
| **Witch, Tribal** | Outside-society magic; "evil eye" | Intense emotion, folk methods | Feared/respected | Chaos/Fire |
| **Witch, Classic** | Herbal healer; midwife; folk magic | Herbs, potions, practical knowledge | Nature spirits | Earth/Water |
| **Witch, Neopagan** | Modern duotheistic practice | Moon rituals, seasonal ceremonies | Goddess/God duotheism | Ether/Earth |
| **Wizard** | Scholarly; wisdom-based | Study, contemplation | Varies | Air/Order |
| **Techno-Mage** | Technology-magic fusion | Devices, circuits, programming | None | Coin/Order |

**Rule:** Your Crystal School suggests but does not restrict your Modality. A Fire-school character could be a War Witch (Fire/Chaos) or a Smith-Mage (Fire/Earth). The school determines which elemental mana comes easiest; the modality determines how you work with it.

---

# CHAPTER 6: THE LAWS OF MAGIC

## 6.1 The Principle of Cumulative Probability

The core mechanic of Dice Godz spellcasting is the **Possibility of Spell Success (PoSS)**. Every ingredient in a spell — each Law invoked, each talent applied, each prop used, each piece of knowledge about the target — adds a measurable percentage to PoSS.

**PoSS = Sum of all Probability Increments (p.i.), capped by Magical Luck Limit**

A spell with PoSS 85% cast by a Rank 3 Master (MLL 85%) succeeds 85% of the time. The same spell at 90% PoSS is still capped at 85% because of the rank limit. Only a Magus (MLL 95%) or Adept (MLL 99%) could realize that full potential.

## 6.2 The Laws and Their Contributions

Each Law of Magic, when deliberately applied during spellcasting, adds its probability increment to PoSS:

| Law | PoSS per Use | How to Apply in Dice Godz |
|---|---|---|
| **Knowledge** | +5% | Study the target; use relevant lore skills; research before casting |
| **Self-Knowledge** | +5% | Meditation; accurate self-assessment; knowing your magical strengths |
| **Cause & Effect** | +5% | Repeat exactly what worked before under the same conditions |
| **Synchronicity** | +5% | Cast at astrologically/seasonally significant times; align with natural cycles |
| **Association** | +5% | Foundation for Similarity and Contagion; any shared element counts |
| **Similarity** | +3-8% | Use effigies, dolls, miniatures, drawings, scale models of the target |
| **Contagion** | +5-12% | Use items that touched the target: hair (+8%), blood (+12%), clothing (+5%), personal object (+7%) |
| **Positive Attraction** | +5% | Positive intent draws positive results; healing intent attracts health |
| **Negative Attraction** | +5% | Like repels like; banishing, warding, exorcism |
| **Names** | +5-30% | Public name (+5%), childhood name (+10%), secret name (+15%), true name (+30%) |
| **Words of Power** | +5% | Mantras, incantations, runes, power words in the target's tradition |
| **Personification** | +5% | Treat forces/elements as conscious beings; address the fire, negotiate with the storm |
| **Invocation** | +1-15% (by Piety) | Call upon internal deity connections; channel divine aspect |
| **Evocation** | +1-15% (by Piety) | Call upon external entities; summon spirits for assistance |
| **Identification** | +5% | Become the target through deep empathy; shapeshifting; total association |
| **Infinite Data** | +5% | Acknowledge that more remains unknown; stay open to new information |
| **Finite Senses** | +5% | Account for perception limits; use multiple senses/talents to compensate |
| **Pragmatism** | +5% | If it works, it's valid — regardless of theoretical elegance |
| **True Falsehoods** | +5% | Context-dependent truth; a "lie" that achieves a true result |
| **Synthesis** | +5% | Combine opposing elements/forces for emergent effects |
| **Polarity** | +5% | Work with both poles of a duality simultaneously |
| **Dynamic Balance** | +5% | Maintain equilibrium across all elemental aspects |
| **Perversity** | +15% or -15% | With Negapsi talent: weaponize Murphy's Law (+15%); without: accept background risk (-15% in adverse conditions) |
| **Unity** | +5% | Recognize the fundamental interconnection of all phenomena |

## 6.3 Gemstone Species Law Amplifiers

Each Gemstone Species amplifies specific Laws when used as a spell component:

| Species Property | Law Amplified | Bonus |
|---|---|---|
| **Piezoelectric** (Quartz, Tourmaline) | Words of Power | Additional +3% (vibration resonance) |
| **Fluorescent** (Fluorite, Kunzite, Ruby) | Similarity | Additional +2% (hidden patterns revealed) |
| **Pleochroic** (Alexandrite, Iolite, Tanzanite) | Polarity | Additional +3% (multiple truths simultaneously) |
| **High Mohs Hardness** (Diamond=10, Sapphire=9) | Cause & Effect | Additional +2% (structural certainty) |
| **Amorphous** (Opal, Obsidian) | Chaos/Perversity | Additional +3% (structure-defying) |
| **Formation: Volcanic** (Fire Opal, Peridot, Obsidian) | Fire-domain spells | Additional +3% |
| **Formation: Hydrothermal** (Emerald, Aquamarine) | Water-domain spells | Additional +3% |
| **Formation: Metamorphic** (Garnet, Ruby, Jade) | Transmutation spells | Additional +3% |

# CHAPTER 7: MANA — THE ENERGY OF MAGIC

## 7.1 What Is Mana?

Mana is psychic-spiritual-artistic-charismatic energy. It is the fuel of all magic. In Dice Godz, 1 Mana Point (MP) ≈ 1 Gramcalorie of energy — enough to heat 1 gram of water by 1°C. This grounds magic in physics while allowing the Catalyst Effect: small amounts of precisely focused mana produce spectacular results.

## 7.2 Generating Mana (Raising)

Before casting a spell, the mage must **raise** sufficient mana. Different techniques generate mana at different rates and with different emotional flavors:

| Technique | Speed | Volume | Control | Emotional Flavor | Modality Affinity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Visual** (mandalas, paintings, symbols) | Medium | Medium | High | Awe, beauty | Magician, Ceremonial |
| **Auditory** (chanting, drumming, song) | Medium | High | Medium | Ecstasy, rhythm | Bard, Shaman, Cleric |
| **Kinesthetic** (dance, mudras, martial forms) | Fast | Medium | Low | Vitality, trance | Shaman, Witch, Medicine Person |
| **Mental** (meditation, visualization) | Slow | Very High | Very High | Clarity, peace | Mystic, Wizard, Monk |
| **Biochemical** (potions, herbs, incense) | Fast | Variable | Very Low | Altered perception | Witch, Medicine Person, Ovate |
| **Erotic** (Tantric techniques) | Slow | Very High | Requires mastery | Passion, union | Tantric Master/Mistress only |
| **Spiritual** (invocation, prayer, sacrifice) | Variable | Variable (deity-dependent) | Low (deity decides) | Devotion, surrender | Cleric, Druid, Shaman |

## 7.3 Mana Sources (Tapping)

Beyond self-generated mana, characters can **tap** mana from external sources:

| Source | Chance by Rank (R1/R2/R3/R4/R5) | Investment Needed? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Ether** | 10/20/40/60/80% | Yes (MPs to reach into ambient field) | Safe; slow; infinite supply at low density |
| **Magical Familiar** (CryptoFae) | 100% at all ranks | No | Limited to familiar's own MP pool |
| **Magical Device** | C-10% (Rank/Degree of device) | Varies | Must have appropriate device |
| **Willing Donor** | 10/25/45/70/95% | No (donor's Power) | Mana has donor's emotional flavor |
| **Forced Victim** | 10/25/45/70/95% | Yes (overcome defenses) | Requires Mesmerism; mana carries victim's pain |
| **A Deity** | 10+F / 20+F / 30+F / 40+F / 50+F | Yes (prayer/sacrifice) | F = Piety modifier (-5% to +10%); amount ≤ deity's declared maximum |
| **Ley-Line** | Automatic +20% to ether tapping when on a ley-line | No | Geographic; ley-line nodes give +40% |
| **Gemstone Species** | Species-specific tapping | No | Piezoelectric species can store/release MPs; amount = Mohs × 5 |

## 7.4 Mana Density Zones

| Zone | Description | Effect on Tapping | Effect on Casting | Effect on Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Zero Mana** | Anti-magic dead zone | Impossible | All PoSS reduced to 0% | N/A — can't cast |
| **Low Mana** | Depleted area | All tapping at -20% | All PoSS at -10% | Normal failure types |
| **Normal** | Standard | Baseline | Baseline | Normal |
| **High Mana** | Concentrated area | All tapping at +10% | All PoSS at +5% | Normal |
| **Very High Mana** | Nexus point | All tapping at +20% | All PoSS at +10% | All failures are critical |
| **Wild Mana (Faerie)** | Chaotic abundance | Automatic success | All PoSS at +15% | ALL failures are Disastrous or Total |

## 7.5 Mana and Gemstone Species

Gemstone species interact with the mana system:

- **Piezoelectric species** (Clear Quartz, Black Tourmaline, etc.) can **store** mana: max MPs stored = Mohs Hardness × 5. Stored mana can be released instantly.
- **Pyroelectric species** (Black Tourmaline) generate MPs passively when heated/cooled: 1 MP per 10°C change.
- **Fluorescent species** (Fluorite, Ruby) absorb ambient mana in UV/High Mana zones: 1 MP per hour in High+ zones.
- **Species in their native petal** generate mana harmony: +5% to all tapping within that element.

# CHAPTER 8: SPELLCASTING — THE CRYSTALLINE PROCESS

## 8.1 The Ten-Step Spell Casting Procedure

Every spell in Dice Godz follows this process (adapted from AT Chapter 8):

### Step 1: Determine Target and Goal
- **Target:** What you are trying to affect (a person, object, location, force)
- **Goal:** What result you want (heal, move, learn, protect, transform)
- The distinction matters: hitting a lock (target) to open a door (goal) is different from hitting a door (target) to break it (goal).

### Step 2: Gather Information (Law of Knowledge)
- Research the target using mundane and magical means
- Each fact learned about the target adds +5% PoSS (Knowledge)
- Use ESP talents for magical reconnaissance
- Consult gemstone species lore for elemental insights

### Step 3: Choose Psychic Talents
- Select which Psi Talents will accomplish the goal
- Each talent has a base probability increment and MP cost
- Flaired talents (*) get +10% to their p.i.
- Multiple talents can be combined (but probabilities multiply, getting smaller)

### Step 4: Design the Ritual
- Choose props, words, movements, timing
- Each prop related by Similarity or Contagion adds its PoSS bonus
- Gemstone species from the target's element add their Law Amplifier bonus
- Choose mana-raising technique appropriate to your modality

### Step 5: Invoke the Laws of Magic
- Deliberately apply as many Laws as possible
- Each Law adds its probability increment to PoSS
- The more Laws applied, the more reliable the spell
- Document each Law usage on the Spell Recipe Card

### Step 6: Raise Mana
- Generate MPs using your chosen technique(s)
- If self-generated MPs are insufficient, **tap** from external sources
- Total MPs needed = Base Cost (from talent) + Task Cost (from spell formula)
- Account for target's defenses (Anti-Psi shielding adds to cost)

### Step 7: Focus and Shape
- Direct the raised mana through chosen Talents
- Apply Magical Clarity Limit — this determines how precisely you shape the spell
- Higher MCL = more precise targeting = better results
- Environmental factors (mana density, psychic static, range) modify here

### Step 8: Release
- Send the shaped energy toward the target
- Roll percentile dice against PoSS
- If roll ≤ PoSS: **Success** (degree determined by how far below PoSS)
- If roll > PoSS: **Failure** (type determined by how far above PoSS)

### Step 9: Evaluate
- Assess results: did the spell achieve the goal?
- Monitor for Spell Decay on persistent effects (Table 8.6)
- Note any unexpected side effects (especially in Wild Mana zones)

### Step 10: Record
- Document the spell on a Spell Recipe Card (see Chapter 18)
- Record conditions, results, and success/failure
- After 10 field successes, Past Success bonus reaches maximum (+20%)

## 8.2 MP Cost Formulas (Physics-Based)

Spell costs are derived from the physical work being performed:

| Action | Formula | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Levitate object** | MPC = 3 × mass_kg × distance_m | 10kg up 5m = 150 MPs |
| **Throw object (PK)** | MPC = (1/8) × mass_kg × velocity_m/s² | 0.2kg at 40m/s = 40 MPs |
| **Throw upward (Gravity)** | MPC = 5 × mass_kg × distance_m | 0.2kg up 50m = 50 MPs |
| **Pump heat** | MPC = gramcalories pumped | 3 liters by 1000°C = 3,000,000 MPs (needs tapping!) |
| **Cook living tissue** | MPC = 150 × mass_g | One human heart (~300g) = 45,000 MPs |
| **Magnetize steel** | MPC = mass_kg (to saturation) | 1kg sword = 1 MP |
| **Create light** | MPC = 5 × lumens × minutes / Focus Factor | 100 watt bulb equivalent = 250 MPs for 10 min |
| **Lightning bolt** | MPC = 25 × kilovolts × amps × tenths_of_second | Small bolt = 25 × 10 × 5 × 3 = 3,750 MPs |
| **Teleport/Apport** | MPC = mass_kg | Human (70kg) = 70 MPs (arbitrary, for playability) |
| **Command intelligence** | MPC = INT + EGO of target | Smart, willful targets cost more |
| **Blow a hole (PK/CPK)** | MPC = 3 × footpounds of energy | .45 auto equivalent = 125 MPs × 3 = 375 MPs |
| **Heal (CPK)** | MPC = HP healed | 20 HP damage = 20 MPs |

## 8.3 Spell Failure Types

When a spell fails, the *type* of failure depends on how badly the roll missed:

| Failure Type | Roll vs PoSS | Effect | Narrative |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Minor Failure** | Missed by 1-20% | Spell mostly works but with a flaw | Does what you wanted, plus something small and unintended |
| **Major Failure** | Missed by 21-50% | Spell partially works or does something similar but wrong | Half the intended effect, or the right effect on the wrong target |
| **Disastrous Failure** | Missed by 51-80% | Spell does something completely different | Explosion, fireball, brilliant flash — excess energy released dramatically |
| **Total Failure** | Missed by 81%+ | Spell does nothing at all | Energy simply dissipates; nothing happens; MPs are lost |

**Note:** In **Very High Mana** zones, all failures become critical (skip Minor). In **Wild Mana (Faerie)** zones, all failures are Disastrous or Total.

## 8.4 Spell Persistence and Decay

Persistent spells (wards, enchantments, long-range effects) decay over time:

**Probability of Spell Persistence (ProSPer):** Roll percentile dice at each Standard Time Unit (STU, default = 1 day). If you roll above the ProSPer threshold, the spell has failed.

ProSPer decreases with time. Higher-rank casters create more durable spells:

| Time (STUs) | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 | Rank 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.25 | .77 | .91 | .95 | .97 | .99 |
| 1.0 | .35 | .55 | .72 | .85 | .93 |
| 3.0 | .09 | .25 | .46 | .69 | .86 |
| 10.0 | .00 | .00 | .00 | .00 | .60 |
| 100 | .00 | .00 | .00 | .00 | .00 |

# CHAPTER 9: ANTI-PSI — SHIELDS, WARDS & COUNTERMAGIC

## 9.1 The Three Shield Types

Anti-Psi is its own discipline — the art of defending against magic. Three types of shielding exist:

### Power Shields (Damping & Amplifying)
- **Damping:** 1 MP of shielding reduces incoming spell power by ÷10. A 5 MP Damping shield reduces a 50 MP attack to 5+10(15) effective MPs.
- **Amplifying:** 1 MP of shielding multiplies incoming spell power by ×10. This is an *offensive* use of Anti-Psi — redirecting amplified energy back.
- **Gemstone Enhancement:** Earth-element species (Jade, Malachite) add Mohs/2 bonus MPs to Damping shields.

### Vector Shields (Deflection & Reddopsi)
- **Deflection:** 1 MP redirects 1 MP of incoming spell in a random direction (roll 1D6: 1=15°, 2=45°, 3=75°, 4=105°, 5=135°, 6=165°).
- **Reddopsi:** 1 MP returns 1 MP directly to the sender. Always returns to origin, even around corners.
- **Gemstone Enhancement:** Air-element species (Kyanite, Selenite) add Mohs/2 bonus MPs to Vector shields.

### Meaning Shields (Negapsi, Filtering, Retuning)
- **Negapsi:** 1 MP reverses the *meaning* of 1 MP of incoming energy. A 50 MP heat spell hitting a 30 MP Negapsi shield: 30 MPs become cold, 20 MPs of heat get through. Net effect: 10 MP cold spell.
- **Filtering:** 1 MP strips the *meaning* and accepts the *power* as pure mana. Useful for accepting "gifts" of mana.
- **Retuning:** 1 MP changes the type/flavor of incoming energy to whatever the receiver desires.
- **Gemstone Enhancement:** Chaos-element species (Opal, Labradorite) add Mohs/2 bonus MPs to Meaning shields.

## 9.2 Combining Shields

Shields can be combined for layered defense:

```
Example: 5 MP Amplifying + 5 MP Reddopsi
- Incoming 60 MP attack
- Amplifying ×10: attack is now 600 MP effective
- But only 5 MPs of the original get through the Amplifying shield
- Those 5 MPs hit the Reddopsi shield and return to sender
- Sender receives 5 MPs × Amplifying effect = 50+ MPs returned!
```

**Cost:** Maintaining a shield costs its base MP cost per turn (combat round). A shield is the ONLY magical action that can run concurrently with another spell — but the shield must be temporarily "opened" at the moment of casting your own spell.

## 9.3 Instinctive Psychic Defense

When a character with active Psi talents faces mortal danger:
- Subconscious notices threat (05-10% chance per round of combat)
- Releases 01-90% of Magical Power through whatever active talents exist
- No Laws of Magic apply (raw, uncontrolled)
- PoS = Magical Luck Limit
- Results are subtle but real (attacker trips, weapon jams, fire flickers)

## 9.4 Dying Curse

When a magic user suffers lethal damage:
- May release **100% of remaining Magical Strength** as a final curse
- Target: the attacker(s)
- Uses whatever Psi Talents the dying character possessed
- PoS = Magical Luck Limit (should succeed — dying focuses the mind)
- Magical Clarity = 100% (death is the ultimate focus)
- **This is the most dangerous moment in magical combat.** Wise opponents coup de grâce magic users from behind shields.

# CHAPTER 10: THE FIVE RANKS OF MASTERY

## 10.1 Rank Overview

| Rank | Title | Condensation | Ether Tap | MLL | MCL Range | Character |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Untrained** | Cannot condense | Cannot tap | 50% | 0-15% | Raw talent only; no magical training |
| 1 | **Apprentice** | 100-1000 min | 10% | 80% | 25-50% | Learning; needs teacher; unreliable |
| 2 | **Journeyman/woman** | 10 min condensed | 20% | 75% | 45-70% | Independent; competent; the "sophomore slump" |
| 3 | **Master/Mistress** | 1 min condensed | 40% | 85% | 60-85% | Can teach; deep understanding; combat-ready |
| 4 | **Magus** | 6 sec condensed | 60% | 95% | 75-95% | Near-instantaneous; vast strategic power |
| 5 | **Adept** | 0.6 sec condensed | 80% | 99% | 90-99% | Transcendent; reality-shaping; legendary |

## 10.2 What Changes at Each Rank

**Rank 1 → 2 (Apprentice to Journeyman):**
- Condensation time drops from 100+ minutes to 10 minutes
- Can work independently (no teacher required)
- Ether tapping doubles (10% → 20%)
- MLL paradoxically *drops* (80% → 75%) because you attempt harder things
- New Psi Talents may become available (roll vs Tables 5.1/5.2)

**Rank 2 → 3 (Journeyman to Master):**
- Condensation drops to 1 minute (combat-speed magic becomes possible)
- Can now **teach** others (grant Apprentice training)
- Ether tapping doubles again (20% → 40%)
- MLL rises to 85% (mastery returns confidence)
- Clerical Tapping becomes powerful (deity relationship deepens)

**Rank 3 → 4 (Master to Magus):**
- Condensation drops to 6 seconds (one combat round)
- Can create 4th degree magical devices
- Ether tapping at 60%; can tap enormous amounts (p≤16B)
- MLL at 95% — near-certain success on practiced spells
- Major Spell Variations created in 10 minutes

**Rank 4 → 5 (Magus to Adept):**
- Condensation at 0.6 seconds (faster than thought)
- Can create 5th degree devices (legendary artifacts)
- Ether tapping at 80%; up to 32× Magical Strength available
- MLL at 99% — failure is almost always due to Perversity or interference
- New spells invented in 1 minute; variations in seconds

## 10.3 Non-Mage Magic Users

Not every character who uses magic is a professional. Three types of non-mages exist (per Greg Stafford, AT pp.141-142):

| Type | Knowledge | Practice | Max Rank | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Type A** | Outer forms only (words, gestures) | None | R0 | ~20% success; doesn't understand *why* it works; most non-mages in low-magic worlds |
| **Type B** | Inner and outer forms | Occasional | R1-2 | Knows the theory; uses tables/formulas; part-timer; "retired mage" |
| **Type C** | Full understanding | Regular (1-2 days/week) | R3 | Serious hobbyist; progresses at half speed; can advance to R3 max |

# CHAPTER 11: THE DIVINE DIMENSION — GODS OF THE MANDALA

## 11.1 What Are the Gods?

In Dice Godz, a **god** or **goddess** is an intelligent entity composed of pure mana, with approximately a billion Mana Points and a billion Hit Points. Gods are *living patterns* in the collective unconscious — shaped by the worship, belief, and emotional investment of their followers across generations.

A **godling** or **demiurge** has ~1,000,000 MPs and HPs.

Deities are not stat blocks to be defeated. They are cosmic-scale entities that exist on multiple planes simultaneously. The relationship between deity and worshipper is **reciprocal** — the deity gives blessings in exchange for mana generated through worship.

## 11.2 The TEK8 Pantheon

Each elemental petal has associated divine forces:

| Element | Deity Archetype | Gut/Head | Example Domains | Spirit Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fire** | Forge God/War Goddess | Gut | Combat, craft, transformation, courage | Salamanders |
| **Earth** | Earth Mother/Harvest Lord | Gut | Fertility, growth, death-rebirth, animals | Gnomes, Dryads |
| **Water** | Sea Goddess/River Father | Gut/Head | Healing, memory, prophecy, emotions | Undines, Oceanids |
| **Air** | Sky Father/Wind Goddess | Head | Knowledge, law, truth, communication | Sylphs |
| **Coin** | Merchant God/Fortune Goddess | Gut | Trade, luck, technology, electricity | — |
| **Chaos** | Trickster/Wild Goddess | Gut | Change, rebellion, creativity, surprise | Faeries |
| **Ether** | Moon Goddess/Dream Lord | Head | Spirit, music, transcendence, death | Sprites, Ancestors |
| **Order** | Judge God/Archive Goddess | Head | Structure, time, karma, recording | Artificial Elementals |

**Gut Deities** are concerned with physical needs: combat, food, shelter, reproduction. They have raw power and respond to offerings of blood, food, and strong emotion.

**Head Deities** are concerned with intellectual and spiritual matters: art, wisdom, science, governance. They respond to offerings of devotion, creative work, and contemplation.

## 11.3 Deity Wakefulness

| Status | Worshippers | Contact Difficulty | Power Level | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Wide Awake** | Millions+ active daily | Easy (10% + Piety) | Full power | Hindu deities, Voudoun Loa |
| **Drowsy** | Thousands active | Moderate (5% + Piety) | 75% power | Active Neopagan reconstructions |
| **Sleeping** | Few hundred or mythological memory | Difficult (1% + Piety) | 50% power | Most ancient Paleopagan gods |
| **Deep Sleep** | None active; archaeological memory | Very Difficult (0.1% + Piety) | 25% power | Forgotten deities of lost civilizations |

**Rule:** Rousing a Sleeping deity is possible but unpredictable. The deity may be confused, angry, or delighted. Sleeping deities do not follow their traditional personality — they have been dreaming.

## 11.4 Worship as Mana Exchange

The **Five Phases of Worship** generate and channel mana:

1. **Starting the Rite:** Congregation gathers; sacred space/time established; group mind forms
2. **Opening the Gates:** Prayers and invocations establish psychic link with deity; ley-lines to temples activate
3. **Major Sending:** Mana raised by congregation through chanting/sacrifice/ritual is sent to deity on the spiritual plane
4. **Receiving the Return:** Deity sends back amplified mana; Clerics channel this power for blessings, healing, or spellcasting
5. **Unwinding:** Careful reversal; thanks offered; gates closed; patterns released; congregation disperses energized

**Mount Olympus Savings & Loan:** Every act of worship "deposits" mana in the deity's account. The deity's "blessings" are compound interest — they send back more than was deposited to keep worshippers coming back.

## 11.5 Piety & State of Grace

**Piety** is a character stat (3D6 base) representing innate divine connection.

**State of Grace** is a dynamic tracker representing current standing with your deity:

| State | Tapping Modifier | Miracle Chance | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Exalted** | +10% | 5% per prayer | Deity actively watches over you; frequent subtle blessings |
| **High** | +5% | 3% per prayer | Deity is pleased; reliable divine support |
| **Normal** | +0% | 1% per prayer | Standard relationship; deity responds when formally asked |
| **Low** | -5% | 0.5% per prayer | Deity is disappointed; requests may be ignored |
| **Fallen** | -15% | 0% | Deity is angered; prayers may be answered with punishment |

# CHAPTER 12: MAGICAL DEVICES — ENCHANTED STONES & ARTIFACTS

## 12.1 Devices in Dice Godz

Magical devices are **astral spell-patterns** frozen around or within physical objects. They are not inherently magical — they are echoes of magical *processes* attached to matter.

In Dice Godz, the 64 Gemstone Species are the natural anchors for magical devices. Their crystalline structures hold mana patterns more effectively than any other material.

## 12.2 Device Types

| Type | Function | Gemstone Role | User Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tapping Device** | Channel mana from external sources | Piezoelectric species (Quartz, Tourmaline) excel | Little to no Psi needed |
| **Teaching Device** | Teach/help condense a spell | Fluorescent species (Fluorite, Ruby) excel | Minimum Psi Potential + relevant talents |
| **Triggering Device** | Release pre-built spell under conditions | Any species; Mohs hardness = stability | Thought trigger from user, target, or environment |

## 12.3 Device Degrees

| Degree | Maker Rank | Max Spell Level | User Psi Minimum | Gemstone Minimum Mohs | Rarity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1st | Apprentice (R1) | Cantrips, wards | 0 | 3 | Common |
| 2nd | Journeyman (R2) | Low-medium spells | Low (PR 8+) | 5 | Uncommon |
| 3rd | Master (R3) | Medium-high spells | Medium (PR 12+) | 6 | Rare |
| 4th | Magus (R4) | High spells | Medium-High (PR 15+) | 7 | Very Rare |
| 5th | Adept (R5) | Highest spells | High (PR 17+) | 8 | Legendary |

## 12.4 Device Decay

All devices decay. Their **ProSPer** (Probability of Spell Persistence) decreases over time based on the maker's rank when the device was created.

**Gemstone Stabilization:** A device anchored in a gemstone species adds the species' **Stability** score to its ProSPer threshold at each check:
- Diamond (Cubic, Stability 10): +10% to ProSPer at every decay check
- Amethyst (Trigonal, Stability 7): +7%
- Opal (Amorphous, Stability 2): +2% (Chaos devices are inherently unstable)

## 12.5 Amulets, Talismans & Weapons

| Device | Nature | Gemstone Requirement | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Amulet** | Natural stone believed to attract/repel by association | Any species in appropriate element | Passive: worn for continuous low-level effect (e.g., Turquoise amulet repels drowning = Water ward) |
| **Talisman** | Graphic representation of a complete spell; requires Contagion with user | Must be carved/inscribed with spell sigils | Active: triggered by user thought; single-use or rechargeable |
| **Magical Weapon** | Weapon with "pluses on damage" and/or "pluses on hits" | Gemstone pommel/inlay acts as mana reservoir | Pluses on damage: mana acts as explosive enhancement; Pluses on hits: mana aids penetration; Banes: extra power vs. specific foe types |

---

# CHAPTER 13: THE RAINBOW ROADS — TERRITORY & EXPLORATION

## 13.1 The 40 Territories

Each of the 8 TEK8 petals contains 5 positions on the Rainbow Roads:

| Position | Code | Meaning | Mana Density | Species Found |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Outer Ring** | OUT | Beginning exploration; accessible | Normal | Common species |
| **Upward Path** | UP | Ascending toward petal center | Normal-High | Common-Uncommon |
| **Downward Path** | DWN | Descending into petal depths | High | Uncommon-Rare |
| **Upper Crossing** | U45 | 45° above — boundary with adjacent petal | High | Boundary species; Rare |
| **Lower Crossing** | D45 | 45° below — boundary with opposite petal | Very High | Rare-Legendary |

**Total territories:** 8 petals × 5 positions = **40 Rainbow Roads**

## 13.2 Gemstone Discovery by Territory

Players discover new Gemstone Species as they explore:

| Discovery Method | Difficulty | Typical Location | Reward |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Surface Find** | Easy | OUT territories | Common species |
| **Deep Mining** | Medium | DWN territories | Uncommon-Rare species |
| **Elemental Convergence** | Hard | U45/D45 crossings | Boundary species; Rare |
| **Champion Session** (TTRPG) | Variable | Any, GM-determined | Any rarity; loot from completed quests |
| **Garden Growing** (IRL) | Slow (seasonal) | Physical garden petal-beds | Common-Uncommon; real-world connection |
| **Trade/Gift** | Social | Between players | Any; carries lineage history |

## 13.3 Ley-Lines on the Rainbow Roads

Ley-lines connect territories across petals:

- **Primary Ley-Lines** connect adjacent petals along the Creation Cycle (Fire→Earth→Water→Air→Fire)
- **Secondary Ley-Lines** connect the Coin→Chaos→Ether→Order→Coin cycle
- **Opposition Ley-Lines** connect polar opposites (Fire↔Water, Earth↔Air, Coin↔Ether, Chaos↔Order)
- **The Rainbow Bridge** connects all 8 OUT territories in one great circle

**Ley-Line Effects:** Standing on a ley-line grants +20% to ether tapping. Ley-line intersections (nodes) grant +40% and count as High Mana zones.

---

# CHAPTER 14: CRYPTOFAE — COMPANION SPECIES & EVOLUTION

## 14.1 The Eight Base Species

Each TEK8 petal has one CryptoFae base species:

| CryptoFae | Petal | Personality | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Emberkin** | D4 Fire | Fierce, creative, impulsive | Familiar; fire-tapping amplifier |
| **Stoneheart** | D6 Earth | Patient, loyal, grounding | Familiar; earth-tapping amplifier |
| **Tideling** | D20 Water | Empathic, flowing, remembering | Familiar; water-tapping amplifier |
| **Zephling** | D8 Air | Quick, curious, communicative | Familiar; air-tapping amplifier |
| **Fortunate** | D2 Coin | Opportunistic, generous, electric | Familiar; coin-tapping amplifier |
| **Trickwisp** | D10 Chaos | Unpredictable, playful, mutating | Familiar; chaos-tapping amplifier |
| **Ethersong** | D12 Ether | Dreamy, resonant, transcendent | Familiar; ether-tapping amplifier |
| **Codex** | D100 Order | Precise, archival, structured | Familiar; order-tapping amplifier |

## 14.2 Gemstone Evolution Paths

Each CryptoFae evolves through 8 gemstone-subspecies stages matching its petal:

**Example: Emberkin (Fire)**
```
Stage 1: Red Jasper Form    (slow burning, foundational)
Stage 2: Carnelian Form     (sacral fire, creative)
Stage 3: Pyrite Form        (sparking, electric-fire)
Stage 4: Sunstone Form      (solar, radiant)
Stage 5: Garnet Form        (deep fire, warrior)
Stage 6: Spinel Form        (hidden fire, deceptive power)
Stage 7: Fire Opal Form     (volcanic, explosive)
Stage 8: Ruby Form          (perfected fire, sovereign)
```

Each evolution stage grants the CryptoFae:
- The gemstone's **Defense** (Mohs Hardness)
- The gemstone's **Custom Ability**
- The gemstone's **Kala Affinity** (adding to player's skills)
- Increased **Mana Pool** (stage × 10 MPs available for tapping)

## 14.3 CryptoFae as Magical Familiars

In the AT system, a **familiar** is "a living magical device acquired by or given to a magician." CryptoFae serve this role:

- **Mana Tapping:** 100% success rate at all ranks (the familiar *wants* to share)
- **No Investment Required:** The familiar's mana flows freely to its bonded mage
- **Familiar Pool:** Limited by CryptoFae's current evolution stage × 10 MPs
- **Emotional Bond:** Mana from a CryptoFae carries the emotional flavor of the bond — love, loyalty, playfulness. This can enhance or interfere with spells depending on the emotional match.
- **Familiar Death:** If the CryptoFae is killed, the bonded mage suffers a psychic shock equal to 50% of the familiar's total MPs in raw damage.

# CHAPTER 16: COMBAT — THE 360-DEGREE CRYSTAL ARENA

## 16.1 The Arena

All combat in Dice Godz takes place on a 360-degree circular arena divided into 8 elemental sectors of 45° each:

```
         0°/360° (Air)
    315° ──┼── 45°
  (Coin)  ╱│╲  (Fire)
  270° ──┤ │ ├── 90°
 (Order) ╲│╱  (Earth)
    225° ──┼── 135°
  (Chaos)    (Water)
    180° (Ether)
```

## 16.2 Elemental Advantage

- **Attacking from your element's sector:** +15% to hit
- **Defending against your opposing element:** Resistance (reduce damage by Mohs Hardness of bonded gemstone)
- **Attacking with opposing element synthesis:** If you can combine Fire+Water (or any opposing pair), damage is doubled but PoSS is halved

## 16.3 Magical Combat Sequence

1. **Initiative:** Roll element die + Condensation Speed bonus
2. **Shield Phase:** Declare and pay for Anti-Psi shields (may run concurrently)
3. **Cast Phase:** Announce spell, open shield momentarily, roll PoSS
4. **Resolution:** Apply success/failure; apply target's shields; determine damage/effect
5. **Decay Check:** Persistent effects roll ProSPer
6. **Recovery:** Regenerate MPs (10% of Magical Strength per hour of rest; 25% per 6 hours)

## 16.4 Gemstone Species in Combat

Your bonded gemstone species modifies combat:
- **Angle Bonus:** +15% when attacking from species' native elemental sector
- **Defense Rating:** Mohs Hardness = damage reduction
- **Stability:** Crystal system mapping = resistance to being knocked off position
- **Special Properties:** Piezoelectric species generate counter-charge on impact; fluorescent species glow as warning when hostile magic approaches; pleochroic species grant +2 to dodge (multiple perception angles)

# CHAPTER 17: SESSION PLAY — THE CHAMPION SYSTEM

## 17.1 Champions

A **Champion** is a player character who participates in TTRPG sessions (called **Champion Sessions**). Session outcomes affect the on-chain state of the player's portfolio.

## 17.2 Session Outcomes

| Outcome | Token Effect | Species Effect | Territory Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Victory** | +XP tokens | May discover new species | Territory defended/expanded |
| **Partial Success** | +Partial XP | Species bond strengthens (+1% to casting with this species) | Territory holds |
| **Defeat** | No XP lost (learning) | Species bond tested (if bonded species "dies," enters dormancy; can be reawakened) | Territory may shift |
| **Discovery** | Discovery tokens | New species added to collection | New territory opened |

## 17.3 Spell Recipe Cards in Play

During Champion Sessions, players use **Spell Recipe Cards** (Chapter 18) to track their prepared spells. Each card records the spell's components, PoSS, MP cost, and casting time. Cards are created between sessions and used during play.

## 18.2 Sample Spell Recipe

**CRYSTALLINE FORGE WARD**
*(to be used by Rank 2 Journeyman Smith-Mage)*

**Props:** Ruby cabochon (Fire petal, bonded species), iron tongs, forge fire, pyrite dust

**Talents:**
- Heat Control* (flaired): 16% p.i., 07 MPs (base)
- Negapsi: 10% p.i., 04 MPs (base)

**Laws:**
- Knowledge (forge metallurgy): 05%
- Similarity (pyrite = fire-in-metal): 06%
- Similarity (ruby = perfected fire): 07%
- Contagion (ruby bonded to caster): 10%
- Words of Power ("Agni raksha"): 05%
- Invocation (Forge God, Piety=12): 08%

**Bonuses:**
- Specialty (Fire/Smithing): 06% (R2 × 03%)
- Past Success: 15% (7 successful castings)
- Gemstone Amplifier (Ruby, volcanic formation): +3% fire-domain

**Total PoSS:** 91% → capped at MLL (R2) = **75%**

**Base Cost:** 11 MPs (Heat + Negapsi)
**Task Cost:** 15 MPs (ward covers 3m radius forge for 1 STU)
**Total Cost:** 26 MPs

**Time:** 10 minutes (condensed at R2)
**Range:** 3m radius centered on forge
**Max Clarity:** 65%
**Tapping:** Not usually needed (26 MPs within R2 Power)

**Description:** Light forge fire. Heat tongs until cherry red. Place ruby cabochon on anvil. Scatter pyrite dust in circle around forge. Chant "Agni raksha, Agni raksha" while visualizing protective heat dome. Strike tongs on anvil three times. Place ruby at forge center. Ward activates — incoming Water/Cold spells are Negapsi-reversed at the ward boundary; Fire spells pass through freely.

**Gemstone Bonus:** Ruby (Mohs 9) adds +3% fire-domain bonus. Fluorescent under UV = hidden patterns revealed if ward is probed. Defense 9 on the ward structure itself.

**History:**
- Field 1: Success. Held against rain-summoning shaman for 4 hours.
- Field 2: Minor Failure. Ward activated but covered only 2m radius.
- Field 3-7: Success. Standard forge protection during enchanting work.
