# DICE GODZ ATTRIBUTE SYSTEM COMPARISON
## v1.0 → v2.0 → v3.0 Etymology, Language Magic, and Notes Toward v3.1

*Document Version: 1.0 — 2026-02-08*
*Purpose: Side-by-side analysis of how the original attribute system was transformed across versions, with etymological/linguistic diagnosis and restoration notes.*

## THE PROBLEM

In v3.0, the Six Opulences of Bhagavan — a deeply rooted Vedic philosophical framework that gave Dice Godz its unique soul — were replaced by 9 generic stats borrowed from the D&D tradition (STR, INT, WIS, CON, DEX, CHA, EGO, PIE, PER). This document traces what was lost and charts the path back.

## SIDE-BY-SIDE: THREE GENERATIONS

### Layer 1: Primary Character Attributes

| Slot | v1.0 (Core Rules 2023) | v2.0 (Emerald Chariot / GWE) | v3.0 (Comprehensive) | Winner |
|------|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| 1 | Attack (Fire) | **Strength** (OP) | STR, DEX, CON | v2.0 |
| 2 | Defense (Earth) | **Fame** (OP) | CHA, PER | v2.0 |
| 3 | Speed (Air) | **Wealth** (OP) | (removed) | v2.0 |
| 4 | Ego (Chaos) | **Knowledge** (OP) | INT, WIS | v2.0 |
| 5 | Range (Aether) | **Beauty** (OP) | (absorbed into CHA) | v2.0 |
| 6 | Mana (Water) | **Renunciation** (OP) | PIE, EGO | v2.0 |

### Layer 2: Derivation Method

| Version | How Stats Are Born | Source of Meaning |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **v1.0** | Elemental % × 42 (from World Egg card) | Combat pragmatism — what does your element *do* in battle? |
| **v2.0** | Karma → Opulence Points → Player distributes across 6 Opulences | Vedic cosmology — who are you as a *soul*? |
| **v3.0** | 3D6 per stat (9 stats) | Generic RPG convention — who are you as a *body*? |

### Layer 3: Elemental Sense Mapping (Consistent Across v1.0 and v2.0, Lost in v3.0)

| Element | Dice | Sense | Ability | Opulence | v3.0 Replaced With |
|---------|------|-------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Fire | D4 | Sight | Agility | **Beauty** | DEX + CHA fragments |
| Earth | D6 | Smell | Endurance | *(Foundation?)* | CON |
| Air | D8 | Touch | Strength | **Strength** | STR |
| Water | D20 | Taste | Empathy | *(unassigned)* | WIS fragments |
| Chaos | D10 | Mind | Willpower | **Renunciation** | EGO |
| Ether | D12 | Sound | Creativity | **Fame** | CHA + PER fragments |
| Order | D100 | Intelligence | Focus | **Knowledge** | INT |
| Coin | D2 | Ownership | Instinct | **Wealth** | (removed entirely) |

## ETYMOLOGICAL DEEP DIVE: The Six Opulences vs. The Nine D&D-isms

### The Opulences (Sanskrit: *Bhaga*)

The Six Opulences define *Bhagavan* — the Supreme Person in Vedic philosophy. They appear in the *Vishnu Purana* (1.22.66): "Complete wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge, and renunciation — these six are called *bhaga*." The word *Bhagavan* itself means "one who possesses all *bhaga*."

Each Opulence is not a body stat. It is a quality of **divine fullness** — a facet of what it means to be complete.

#### 1. STRENGTH (*Bala*)

| | Opulence: Strength | D&D: STR |
|---|---|---|
| **Sanskrit root** | *bal* — to breathe, to live, to be powerful | None (Old English *strengþu*, "bodily power") |
| **Scope** | Spiritual fortitude, cosmic power, the force that upholds dharma | Can you lift a heavy thing? |
| **TEK8 Element** | Air (D8) — the breath of life, *prana*, the invisible force | N/A |
| **Implied question** | "What can you sustain?" | "What can you lift?" |
| **Language magic** | Connects to *prana*, breath, vitality, the power behind wind | Reduces to muscle mass |

#### 2. BEAUTY (*Shri*)

| | Opulence: Beauty | D&D: CHA |
|---|---|---|
| **Sanskrit root** | *Shri* — radiance, auspiciousness, the splendor of form | Greek *kharisma*, "gift of grace" |
| **Scope** | The attractiveness of truth; the beauty that compels devotion | Social manipulation skill |
| **TEK8 Element** | Fire (D4) — the light that reveals, the flame that draws the eye | N/A |
| **Implied question** | "What is radiant about you?" | "Can you persuade someone?" |
| **Language magic** | *Shri* is a honorific prefix (Shri Krishna) meaning "sacred beauty" | Charisma in D&D became a dump stat for fighters |

#### 3. FAME (*Yashas*)

| | Opulence: Fame | D&D: CHA (partial) |
|---|---|---|
| **Sanskrit root** | *yash* — glory, splendor, that which is celebrated | (No direct equivalent; fragmented across CHA/reputation) |
| **Scope** | The resonance of your deeds through time; the story the cosmos tells about you | Subsumed into "social skills" |
| **TEK8 Element** | Ether (D12) — sound, vibration, the medium through which stories travel | N/A |
| **Implied question** | "What echoes after you?" | (Not asked) |
| **Language magic** | *Yashas* shares roots with *yajna* (sacred offering) — fame earned through sacrifice | D&D has no fame stat; your reputation is a DM judgment call |

#### 4. KNOWLEDGE (*Jnana*)

| | Opulence: Knowledge | D&D: INT |
|---|---|---|
| **Sanskrit root** | *jna* — to know (cognate with Greek *gnosis*, Latin *cognosco*) | Latin *intelligentia*, "understanding" |
| **Scope** | Direct perception of truth; *jnana* includes experiential and transcendent knowing | Book learning, puzzle solving, recall |
| **TEK8 Element** | Order (D100) — the mathematical, the systematic, the knowable pattern | N/A |
| **Implied question** | "What truth have you perceived directly?" | "How many facts do you remember?" |
| **Language magic** | *Jnana yoga* is one of the four paths to liberation — knowledge as salvation | INT in D&D is primarily a wizard tax |

#### 5. WEALTH (*Aishvarya*)

| | Opulence: Wealth | D&D: (none) |
|---|---|---|
| **Sanskrit root** | *Ishvara* — lord, sovereign, master; *aishvarya* = sovereignty, lordship, wealth | (No equivalent in D&D stats) |
| **Scope** | Command over resources; the capacity to generate, attract, and distribute abundance | D&D tracks gold pieces as inventory, not as a soul quality |
| **TEK8 Element** | Coin (D2) — the binary of exchange, yes/no, give/receive | N/A |
| **Implied question** | "What abundance flows through you?" | (Not asked — wealth is a loot table) |
| **Language magic** | *Aishvarya* implies stewardship, not hoarding; the lord who distributes | D&D's relationship with wealth is extractive (loot dungeons, buy gear) |

#### 6. RENUNCIATION (*Vairagya*)

| | Opulence: Renunciation | D&D: WIS (partial) |
|---|---|---|
| **Sanskrit root** | *vi-raga* — freedom from attachment; *raga* = color, passion, desire | Old English *wis*, "having knowledge" |
| **Scope** | The power to let go; detachment that creates clarity; the fire that doesn't burn | Perception, willpower, common sense |
| **TEK8 Element** | Chaos (D10) — the dissolution of form, the space between patterns | N/A |
| **Implied question** | "What are you free from?" | "Are you perceptive?" |
| **Language magic** | *Vairagya* is the prerequisite for liberation in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras | WIS in D&D is a cleric tax and a saving throw |

## WHAT v3.0 ACTUALLY DID (The Damage Report)

### Replaced 6 Opulences with 9 generic stats:

```
ORIGINAL (v2.0)                    REPLACEMENT (v3.0)
═══════════════                    ══════════════════
Strength  (Bala)      →  STR + CON + DEX (split into 3 body stats)
Fame      (Yashas)    →  CHA + PER (fragmented)
Wealth    (Aishvarya) →  DELETED ENTIRELY
Knowledge (Jnana)     →  INT + WIS (split into 2 mind stats)
Beauty    (Shri)      →  absorbed into CHA
Renunciation (Vairagya) →  PIE + EGO (rebranded)
```

### What was lost:

1. **The Karma → Opulence Points pipeline.** In v2.0, your rolling performance during the Godz World Egg determines your Karma, which determines how many Opulence Points you get to distribute. This means *how you play the creation ritual shapes who you become*. v3.0 replaced this with 3D6-per-stat — the most generic RPG character generation method possible.

2. **The Vedic cosmological anchor.** The Six Opulences aren't arbitrary. They define *Bhagavan* — the divine person. Every Dice Godz character is, in miniature, an expression of the same six qualities that define the Supreme. This gives the game a philosophical backbone that no amount of "Authentic Thaumaturgy" can replace if the foundation is generic.

3. **The elemental-opulence resonance.** Each Opulence maps to a TEK8 element, a sense, an ability, a virtue, a form of capital, and a dimension of wellness. This is an 8-layer correspondence system. 3D6-for-STR has zero layers.

4. **The "two absent" mystery.** Water and Earth have *unassigned* opulences in the original schema. This is not a bug — it's a design koan. The two most fundamental elements (the ground you stand on, the water you drink) have opulences that the *community* must discover. v3.0 filled every slot with boilerplate and killed the mystery.

5. **Wealth as a soul quality.** This is perhaps the most radical thing about the original system. In Dice Godz, Wealth isn't gold pieces in your inventory — it's a facet of your divine nature. *Aishvarya* is sovereignty, stewardship, the capacity to generate abundance. v3.0 deleted this entirely.

6. **Renunciation as power.** Most RPGs have no concept of "letting go" as a source of strength. *Vairagya* mapped to Chaos is brilliant — the willingness to release form IS the chaotic principle. v3.0 turned this into a generic "Piety" stat.

## WHAT v1.0 GOT RIGHT (That Both v2.0 and v3.0 Should Preserve)

The v1.0 **elemental combat attributes** (Attack, Defense, Speed, Ego, Range, Mana) are *not* the same system as the Opulences. They are a **second layer** — what your elemental composition does in tactical play:

| Element | v1.0 Combat Attribute | Derivation |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| Fire | Attack | Elemental % × 42 |
| Earth | Defense | Elemental % × 42 |
| Air | Speed | Elemental % × 42 |
| Chaos | Ego | Elemental % × 42 |
| Aether | Range | Elemental % × 42 |
| Water | Mana | Elemental % × 42 |

These should **coexist** with the Opulences, not replace them. v1.0 had combat stats. v2.0 added soul stats. v3.0 threw out both and substituted D&D's body stats.

## NOTES TOWARD v3.1

### Directive 1: RESTORE THE SIX OPULENCES AS PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES

The character sheet should feature:

```
THE SIX OPULENCES (Distribute [Karma-derived OP] points)
  Strength      (Bala)      — Air    — The power to sustain
  Beauty        (Shri)      — Fire   — The radiance that compels
  Fame          (Yashas)    — Ether  — The echo of your deeds
  Knowledge     (Jnana)     — Order  — Direct perception of truth
  Wealth        (Aishvarya) — Coin   — The flow of abundance
  Renunciation  (Vairagya)  — Chaos  — Freedom from attachment
```

### Directive 2: RESTORE THE KARMA → OP PIPELINE

Keep the v2.0 system where GWE rolling performance determines Karma, which determines OP budget. This is the most original mechanic in Dice Godz and it must not be replaced by 3D6-per-stat.

### Directive 3: REINTEGRATE v1.0 ELEMENTAL COMBAT STATS AS A SECOND LAYER

Preserve Attack/Defense/Speed/Ego/Range/Mana as **derived combat stats** from elemental composition. These are tactical. The Opulences are spiritual. Both coexist.

### Directive 4: PRESERVE THE WATER AND EARTH MYSTERY

Do NOT assign fixed opulences to Water and Earth. The original schema marks Water as "—" and Earth as "(Foundation or Stability?)". This ambiguity is a feature. In v3.1, flag these as **community-discoverable** opulences, consistent with the Modular Species Framework's community governance model.

### Directive 5: MAP BONEWITS' MAGICAL STATS TO THE OPULENCE FRAMEWORK

Instead of adding generic Bonewits stats (INT, WIS, etc.), derive the Authentic Thaumaturgy mechanical requirements FROM the Opulences:

| AT Requirement | v3.1 Derivation |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Psi Potential (PR) | GWE roll (already exists as Karma) |
| Intelligence | **Knowledge** (Jnana) — direct mapping |
| Willpower / Ego | **Renunciation** (Vairagya) — letting go IS will |
| Charisma | **Fame** (Yashas) + **Beauty** (Shri) average |
| Piety | **Renunciation** (Vairagya) + **Knowledge** (Jnana) average |
| Constitution / Endurance | **Strength** (Bala) — which is cosmic vitality, not muscle |
| Perception | Elemental Sense (already in TEK8 layer) |
| Dexterity | Elemental Speed (already in v1.0 combat layer) |

This keeps Bonewits' mechanics while expressing them through the original vocabulary.

### Directive 6: RESTORE MULTI-LAYER CORRESPONDENCE

Every attribute should resonate across all TEK8 layers:

```
Opulence → Element → Dice → Sense → Ability → Virtue → Capital → Wellness
```

This is the "language magic" — each term exists within a web of correspondence that makes it irreducible to a generic equivalent.

### Directive 7: OPULENCE POINTS IN THE AT MAGIC SYSTEM

Where Bonewits requires stats for spell formulas, v3.1 should use:

- **Magical Strength** = f(Strength_OP, Knowledge_OP, elemental composition)
- **Magical Power** = 10% × Magical Strength (preserved from AT)
- **PoSS modifiers** from high Opulence scores (e.g., Knowledge > 4 grants +5% to Laws that involve study)
- **Mana regeneration** enhanced by Renunciation (detachment clears channels)
- **Fame affects divine tapping** (deities respond to those whose *yashas* resonates)

## SUMMARY TABLE: The Journey Home

| Aspect | v1.0 (2023) | v2.0 (Emerald Chariot) | v3.0 (Comprehensive) | v3.1 (Target) |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Attribute count** | 6 combat stats | 6 Opulences + elemental % | 9 generic stats | 6 Opulences + 6 combat stats (dual layer) |
| **Source tradition** | Varaha Lila + original design | Bhagavad Gita / Vishnu Purana | D&D 5e | Vedic + Bonewits synthesis |
| **Derivation** | Elemental % × 42 | Karma → OP → distribute | 3D6 per stat | GWE Karma → OP + Elemental % |
| **Naming language** | English tactical | Sanskrit philosophical | English generic | Sanskrit + English tactical (both) |
| **Cultural depth** | Medium (elemental) | Deep (Vedic cosmology) | Shallow (industry standard) | Deepest (Vedic + AT + TEK8 resonance) |
| **Unique to Dice Godz?** | Partially (elemental % is original) | Yes (no other RPG uses Bhagavan's opulences) | No (any RPG has these stats) | Yes (fully original synthesis) |
| **Water/Earth mystery** | N/A | Preserved (intentional gaps) | Eliminated | Restored |
| **Wealth as stat** | No | Yes (Aishvarya) | No | Yes |
| **Renunciation as stat** | No | Yes (Vairagya) | No | Yes |

---

*The path to v3.1 is not about adding more Bonewits. It's about expressing Bonewits through the language that was already there. The Opulences ARE the stats. They always were.*
