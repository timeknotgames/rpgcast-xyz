# The Bonewits Thaumaturgy Protocol
## A Framework for Evaluating & Evolving RPG Magic Systems Toward Maximum Authenticity
### Derived from *Authentic Thaumaturgy* by Isaac Bonewits (Steve Jackson Games, 2nd Ed. 1998/2005)

> *"A Spell is a process, not a thing. A Spell is a process, not a thing. A Spell is a process, not a thing."*
> — Bonewits, AT p.98 (repeated "several times a game")

> *"Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology."*
> — Bonewits, inverting Clarke's Third Law

---

## PURPOSE

This protocol extracts the core principles, laws, mechanics, and design philosophy from Isaac Bonewits' *Authentic Thaumaturgy* (AT) into a **reusable evaluation and evolution framework** for tabletop RPG systems. Any game designer — whether building a new magic system or refining an existing one — can use this protocol to audit their system against the standards of magical authenticity that Bonewits spent a lifetime studying.

The protocol is organized into **7 Pillars**, each containing evaluation criteria, scoring rubrics, and evolution directives. A system that passes all 7 Pillars has achieved what Bonewits called *thaumaturgical design* — magic that feels real because it is modeled on how magic *actually works* (or is believed to work) across human cultures.

---

## PILLAR I: FOUNDATIONAL PHILOSOPHY
### "Magic Is a Process, Not a Thing"

**Core Principle (AT pp.5-22, 95, 98):** Magic is not a substance that can be stored in jars or fired like bullets. It is a *process* — a series of mental, emotional, and energetic actions that produce results through the manipulation of subtle forces. No two castings of a "spell" are ever identical, because the caster's state of mind, the environmental conditions, and the target's resistance all vary.

### Evaluation Criteria

| # | Criterion | Fail | Pass | Excel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I-1 | **Process over product**: Does the system treat spellcasting as a multi-step process rather than a push-button effect? | Spell = instant effect from a menu | Spell has casting time, components, or procedure | Multi-step procedure with variable outcomes based on conditions |
| I-2 | **No two castings identical**: Does the system allow for variation in spell outcomes? | Same spell always produces identical result | Minor variation (damage dice) | Outcome varies by caster state, environment, target, and method |
| I-3 | **Altered states of consciousness**: Does the system model the mental/emotional requirements of magic? | No mental component | Concentration or willpower check | Mana-raising techniques (meditation, chanting, dance, etc.) affect outcomes |
| I-4 | **TANSTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch)**: Does magic have real costs and consequences? | Spell slots refresh freely after rest | Resource cost (MP, components) | Energy must come from somewhere real (body, environment, deity, sacrifice) |
| I-5 | **The Catalyst Effect**: Can small, well-focused magical actions produce large results? | Power scales linearly with investment | Some efficiency bonuses | Precision, knowledge, and focus multiply effectiveness far beyond raw power invested |
| I-6 | **Mind controls all magic**: Do mental/emotional states affect magical ability? | No effect | Concentration penalties when damaged | Comprehensive: fear, drugs, distraction, confidence, emotional state all modify magic |

### Evolution Directives

- **ED-I-A:** Replace "fire and forget" spell lists with procedural spell construction. Each casting should involve decisions.
- **ED-I-B:** Implement a **Spell Variation** system: familiar spells can be modified on the fly, but with reduced reliability and increased time (AT Formula 9.2a-c).
- **ED-I-C:** Model **mana-raising techniques** as distinct mechanical actions: Visual (props, mandalas), Auditory (chants, music), Kinesthetic (dance, mudras), Mental (meditation), Biochemical (potions), Erotic, Spiritual (invocation/evocation). Each technique contributes mana and affects the spell's character.
- **ED-I-D:** Implement the **Catalyst Effect** — a character with deep knowledge of a narrow domain should vastly outperform a generalist throwing raw power at the same problem.

---

## PILLAR II: THE LAWS OF MAGIC
### "The More Laws You Use, The More Likely Your Spell Succeeds"

**Core Principle (AT pp.56-64, Table 6.1):** Bonewits codified approximately 28 Laws of Magic drawn from cross-cultural study. These laws are not arbitrary game rules — they describe observable patterns in how magical traditions worldwide *actually operate*. Each Law used in a spell adds to its Possibility of Spell Success (PoSS). The more Laws a caster can invoke simultaneously, the more powerful and reliable the result.

### The Laws (with PoSS Contributions)

| Law | AT Definition | PoSS per Use | Design Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Knowledge** | Understanding brings control; the more you know, the more you can do | +5% | Reward research, lore skills, and study of targets |
| **Self-Knowledge** | Know thyself — strengths and weaknesses | +5% | Self-awareness mechanics; flawed self-image penalizes |
| **Cause & Effect** | Same conditions → same results (under identical circumstances) | +5% | Repeatability rewarded; controlled conditions matter |
| **Synchronicity** | Events at the same time share associations beyond coincidence | +5% | Timing mechanics; astrological/seasonal bonuses |
| **Association** | Shared elements create sympathetic links | +5% | Foundation for Similarity and Contagion |
| **Similarity** | Lookalike creates like effect (voodoo dolls, effigies, miniatures) | +3-8% | Props, effigies, symbolic representations boost spells |
| **Contagion** | Things once in contact remain connected | +5-12% | Personal items, hair, blood, touched objects enhance targeting |
| **Positive Attraction** | Like attracts like | +5% | Positive intent draws positive results; healing attracts health |
| **Negative Attraction** | Like repels like (opposite of Positive) | +5% | Banishing, warding, exorcism mechanics |
| **Names** | True names grant power over the named | +5-30% | Public name (+5%), childhood (+10%), secret (+15%), true name (+30%) |
| **Words of Power** | Certain utterances alter reality through sound and meaning | +5% | Mantras, incantations, runes as mechanical components |
| **Personification** | Everything can be treated as alive and responded to as such | +5% | Animism; treating elements/forces as spirits enables interaction |
| **Invocation** | Calling upon entities from within oneself | +1-15% (by Piety) | Internal deity contact; aspect channeling |
| **Evocation** | Calling upon entities external to oneself | +1-15% (by Piety) | Summoning, spirit communication |
| **Identification** | Maximum association — *becoming* the other | +5% | Shapeshifting, possession, deep empathy |
| **Infinite Data** | There is always more to learn | +5% | No knowledge ceiling; research always rewards |
| **Finite Senses** | Every being's senses are limited | +5% | Illusion mechanics; perception limits; concealment |
| **Personal Universes** | Each being's reality is unique and valid | +5% | Subjective reality mechanics; belief shapes experience |
| **Infinite Universes** | All possible combinations of phenomena can be organized | +5% | Multiverse, parallel planes, alternate realities |
| **Pragmatism** | If it works, it's true (for that context) | +5% | Effectiveness validates method; no "wrong" traditions |
| **True Falsehoods** | Things can be "true" in one context and "false" in another | +5% | Paradox magic; context-dependent truth |
| **Synthesis** | Two opposing patterns create a truer third | +5% | Combining opposing elements/forces for greater effect |
| **Polarity** | Any data can be split into opposing characteristics, each containing the other's essence | +5% | Yin-yang; elemental opposition and complementarity |
| **Dynamic Balance** | Survival requires maintaining dynamic balance across all aspects | +5% | Overspecialization penalties; balance rewards |
| **Perversity** | If anything can go wrong, it will (Murphy's Law) | +15% (w/ Negapsi) or -15% | Critical failure tables; chaos factor; Negapsi talent |
| **Unity** | Everything is connected to everything else | +5% | Web of mana; universal connection underlies all magic |

### Evaluation Criteria

| # | Criterion | Fail | Pass | Excel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| II-1 | **Multiple Laws modeled**: Does the system represent at least 8 of the Laws as distinct mechanics? | 0-3 Laws | 4-8 Laws represented | 9+ Laws with distinct mechanical effects |
| II-2 | **Cumulative PoSS**: Do more Laws used = higher success chance? | Binary pass/fail spellcasting | Some factors add bonuses | Explicit cumulative probability system where each ingredient adds measurable % |
| II-3 | **Similarity & Contagion**: Are sympathetic magic components (props, personal items, effigies) mechanically meaningful? | No props system | Props provide minor bonus | Detailed system where specific links (hair=+12%, true name=+30%) have calibrated effects |
| II-4 | **Names have power**: Does knowing a being's name grant mechanical advantage? | No name mechanic | Names provide lore bonus | Tiered name system: public/childhood/secret/true with escalating power |
| II-5 | **Perversity honored**: Can magic fail in interesting, dramatic, and proportional ways? | Spells simply "fail" | Minor/major failure distinction | Four failure types (Minor, Major, Disastrous, Total) with contextual narrative results |

### Evolution Directives

- **ED-II-A:** Implement a **Law Invocation Checklist** for spell construction. Each Law the caster deliberately applies adds its PoSS bonus. This becomes the core spellcasting mechanic.
- **ED-II-B:** Build a **Sympathetic Link** system: objects/substances related to the target add cumulative bonuses based on the type of association (Similarity, Contagion, Names).
- **ED-II-C:** Create a **Spell Failure Matrix** with four failure types (Minor, Major, Disastrous, Total) whose severity increases with time since casting (AT Table 8.7).
- **ED-II-D:** Implement **Perversity** as a wild factor: when Negapsi talent is present, Murphy's Law can be weaponized (+15%); otherwise it acts as a persistent background risk (-15% in adverse conditions).

## PILLAR III: PSYCHIC TALENTS & MODALITIES
### "The Mind Is the Source of All Magic"

**Core Principle (AT pp.23-48):** All magical effects emerge from four categories of psychic talent. Every spell uses one or more of these talents as its engine. Magical traditions (modalities) are *cultural packaging* around the same underlying psychic phenomena.

### The Four Talent Categories

| Category | Talents | Nature | Game Mapping |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ESP** (Extrasensory Perception) | Telepathy (Send/Receive, Empathy, Mesmerism), Clair-Senses (Clairvoyance, Clairaudience, Clairgustance, Clairtangency, Clairolfaction), Psychometry, OOBEs (Astral/Mental Projection) | Passive — receiving information | Perception, divination, communication, scouting |
| **Hypercognition** | Retrocognition, Hypercognition, Precognition | Fast subconscious processing — "hunches" | Lore, prophecy, tactical insight, danger sense |
| **PK** (Psychokinesis) | PK-Proper, Levitation, Apportation, Teleportation, CPK (Cellular PK/Healing), Controls (Mass, Gravity, Density, Magnetic, Electric, Light, Temperature, Radiation, Bonding, Transmutation), Klutzokinesis | Active — moving matter/energy | Combat magic, elemental control, healing, crafting |
| **Anti-Psi** | Catapsi, Splodging, Apopsi, Deflection, Reddopsi, Negapsi, Filtering, Retuning, Damping, Amplifying, Flair | Defensive/disruptive — interfering with psi | Shielding, countermagic, dispelling, spell reflection |

### Magical Modalities (Cultural Packaging)

Bonewits identifies these as cultural *modes* for the same underlying talents:

| Modality | AT Description | Thaumaturgy/Theurgy Balance | Talent Emphasis |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Magician** | Active talent user; practical/physical magic | Mostly Thaumaturgy | All active talents |
| **Mystic** | Passive talent user; spiritual/enlightenment focus | Mostly Theurgy | ESP, Hypercognition |
| **Cleric** (Prophet/Exorcist/Preacher) | Religious magic; deity partnership | Both | All, plus divine tapping |
| **Druid/Ovate/Bard** | Celtic-style nature/knowledge/art magic | Both | All, cultural specialization |
| **Psychic** | Natural talent, minimal training | Varies | Strong innate abilities, weak fine-tuning |
| **Goetic Magician** | Spirit-summoner; ceremonial magic | Thaumaturgy | Evocation, Names emphasis |
| **Medium/Necromancer** | Death-magic and spirit communication | Both | ESP (spirit contact), PK (raising) |
| **Medicine Person/Shaman** | Tribal magical worker; astral traveler | Both | ESP (OOBE), all PK |
| **Witch** (5 types) | Tribal/Classic/Gothic/Neopagan/Feminist | Varies widely by type | Full range |
| **Wizard** | Wise person; scholarly magic | Both | Knowledge-emphasis |

### Evaluation Criteria

| # | Criterion | Fail | Pass | Excel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| III-1 | **Distinct talent categories**: Are passive (perception) and active (manipulation) magical abilities mechanically distinct? | All magic works the same way | 2-3 distinct categories | 4+ categories (ESP, HC, PK, Anti-Psi) with unique mechanics |
| III-2 | **Cultural modalities**: Can the same underlying abilities be expressed through different cultural traditions? | One type of magic user | 2-3 wizard archetypes | Multiple modalities (Mage, Cleric, Shaman, Druid, etc.) accessing same talent pool differently |
| III-3 | **Anti-Psi**: Does the system model counterspelling, shielding, and magical defense as a distinct discipline? | No counterspelling | Basic dispel/counterspell | Full shielding system with Blocking (power), Vector Change (direction), and Meaning Change (content) |
| III-4 | **Flaired vs. non-flaired talents**: Do characters have natural aptitudes that exceed their general magical ability? | Flat ability across all magic | School/specialization bonuses | Specific talents marked as "flaired" (+10% base, independent of training) |
| III-5 | **Non-mage magic**: Can non-magical characters still interact with the magical world? | No magical interaction possible for non-mages | Scrolls/potions usable by anyone | Type A (outer forms only, ~20%), Type B (trained but lapsed), Type C (serious hobbyist) non-mage categories |

### Evolution Directives

- **ED-III-A:** Build a **Psychic Talent Tree** where each talent can be Raw (untrained, faster but less reliable) or Trained (ritualized, slower but much more reliable). This replaces the binary "has spell / doesn't have spell" model.
- **ED-III-B:** Implement **Modality Packages** — culturally-flavored starting configurations that determine which talents are emphasized, what props/techniques are used, and how the character interfaces with the divine.
- **ED-III-C:** Create a full **Anti-Psi Shielding** system with three shield types: Power shields (Damping/Amplifying), Meaning shields (Negapsi/Filtering/Retuning), Vector shields (Deflection/Reddopsi). Shields cost constant mana per turn and can be combined.
- **ED-III-D:** Model **Instinctive Psychic Defense** — when a character with active Psi talents is in mortal danger, their subconscious may fire off an uncontrolled defense, releasing 01-90% of Magical Power at the attacker (AT Formula 9.4).

## PILLAR IV: ENERGETICS & RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
### "Mana Comes from Somewhere and Goes Somewhere"

**Core Principle (AT pp.15-22, 65-88):** Magic requires energy. That energy (mana) is measurable, finite, and must be generated, stored, focused, and released. The art of magic is getting maximum results from minimum investment — the **Catalyst Effect**. Energy has emotional flavor. Environmental factors (mana density, ley-lines, psychic static) dramatically affect what is possible.

### Key Formulas (from AT)

| Formula | Name | Expression | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Mana Point Equivalents | 1 MP ≈ 1 Gramcalorie ≈ 4.2×10⁷ Ergs | Grounds magic in physics |
| 5.1 | Magical Strength | (10^r × (PISC/4)) + MSAT | Maximum daily MP generation |
| 5.2 | Magical Power | 10% × Magical Strength | Maximum MP per single spell |
| 7.1 | Spacial Range Factor | (distance_km × time_min) / Rank | Distance penalty |
| 7.2 | Temporal Range Factor | (time_diff × distance) / Rank | Time-targeting penalty |
| 8.1-8.13 | MP Cost Formulas | Various per PK talent | Physics-based mana costs |
| 9.1 | Spell Condensation | ct = 10^(3-r) minutes | Condensed casting time by rank |
| 9.2a | Major Variation Time | t = 10^(5-r) minutes | Time to create new spell variant |

### Mana Sources (AT Table 8.4)

| Source | Rank 0/1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 | Rank 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **The Ether** | 10% chance, p≤2B | 20%, p≤4B | 40%, p≤8B | 60%, p≤16B | 80%, p≤32B |
| **Magical Familiar** | 100%, No invest | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| **Magical Device** | C-10%, Varies | C-10% | C-10% | C-10% | C-10% |
| **Willing Donor** | 10%, No invest, D | 25% | 45% | 70% | 95% |
| **Forced Victim** | 10%, Yes, p≤E | 25% | 45% | 70% | 95% |
| **A Deity** | 10%+F, Yes, (1≤p≤10)≤G | 20%+F | 30%+F | 40%+F | 50%+F |

### Mana Density Zones (AT Table 7.1)

| Zone | MP Availability | Effect on Magic |
|---|---|---|
| **Zero Mana** | None | No magic possible; anti-magic dead zones |
| **Low Mana** | Scarce | All magic at disadvantage; tapping difficult |
| **Normal** | Standard | Baseline operation |
| **High Mana** | Abundant | Tapping easy; all magic at advantage |
| **Very High Mana** | Extreme | Tapping trivial; all successes enhanced; all failures critical |
| **Wild Mana (Faerie)** | Chaotic abundance | All spells easy but all failures become Disastrous or Total |

### Evaluation Criteria

| # | Criterion | Fail | Pass | Excel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| IV-1 | **Mana as real resource**: Is magical energy tracked, finite, and consequential? | Unlimited magic or trivially renewable | Spell slots, MP, or similar tracked resource | Mana with generation rate (Magical Strength), burst limit (Magical Power), and recovery mechanics |
| IV-2 | **Multiple mana sources**: Can casters draw energy from more than their own body? | Self-only | 2-3 sources (self, items, deities) | 6+ sources: self, ether, familiars, devices, donors, victims, deities, lands — each with distinct risk/reward |
| IV-3 | **Environmental mana variation**: Does the magical environment change across locations? | Uniform magic everywhere | Special magical/antimagical zones | Graduated mana density (Zero→Low→Normal→High→Very High→Wild) with mechanical effects |
| IV-4 | **Ley-lines and sacred sites**: Are there geographical features that channel or concentrate magical energy? | No magical geography | Sacred/cursed sites with flat bonus | Ley-lines as energy highways; nodes as power amplifiers; mana deserts as strategic dead zones |
| IV-5 | **Spell costs grounded in physics**: Are MP costs derived from the physical work being performed? | Arbitrary spell level costs | Some scaling with effect magnitude | Physics-based formulas: levitation costs mass×distance, heat costs gramcalories, lightning costs voltage×current×time |
| IV-6 | **Tapping risk/reward**: Does drawing mana from external sources involve meaningful trade-offs? | No external tapping | Basic tapping with failure chance | Tapping varies by source, rank, and relationship; emotional flavor of tapped mana affects the spell; forced tapping risks backlash |
| IV-7 | **Magical efficiency varies**: Are some magical processes more or less efficient than others? | All magic equally efficient | Broad efficiency tiers | Specific efficiency ratings per formula (Levitation=80%, Heat Pumping=50%, Magnetism=0.8%, Lightning=96%) |

### Evolution Directives

- **ED-IV-A:** Implement **Magical Strength** (daily MP cap) and **Magical Power** (per-spell MP cap) as distinct statistics. A mage with 500 Magical Strength but 50 Magical Power can cast 10 spells per day but none exceeding 50 MP.
- **ED-IV-B:** Create a **Tapping System** with 6+ sources (AT Table 8.4), each requiring different skills, offering different quantities, and carrying different risks. Tapping from the ether is safe but slow; tapping from a deity is powerful but costs Piety; tapping from an unwilling victim is fast but morally perilous.
- **ED-IV-C:** Map the game world with **Mana Density Zones**: Zero, Low, Normal, High, Very High, and Wild Mana areas. Wild Mana (Faerie) zones make all magic easy but all failures catastrophic.
- **ED-IV-D:** Base MP costs on actual physics where possible. Bonewits' formulas (8.1-8.13) provide templates: lifting = mass×distance×3, heating = gramcalories×1, lightning = 25×kilovolts×amps×tenths-of-seconds.
- **ED-IV-E:** Implement **Spell Decay** (AT Tables 8.5-8.7): persistent spells have half-lives that depend on caster rank and time elapsed. Nothing lasts forever, even magic.

## PILLAR V: CHARACTER PROGRESSION & RANK
### "Five Ranks from Apprentice to Adept"

**Core Principle (AT pp.49-55, 90-93):** Magical ability is not a linear progression of accumulating more "spell slots." It is a qualitative transformation across five ranks, each representing a fundamentally different relationship with magic. Higher rank means faster condensation, wider tapping access, higher reliability limits, and deeper understanding — not just "more powerful spells."

### The Five Ranks

| Rank | Title | Condensation Time | Ether Tap | Luck Limit | Character |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0/1 | **Apprentice** | 100-1000 min (uncondensed) | 10%, p≤2B | 50-80% | Learning outer forms; unreliable; needs teacher |
| 2 | **Journeyman/woman** | 10 min (condensed) | 20%, p≤4B | 75% | Competent practitioner; can work alone |
| 3 | **Master/Mistress** | 1 min (condensed) | 40%, p≤8B | 85% | Can teach; deep understanding; reliable |
| 4 | **Magus** | 6 sec (condensed) | 60%, p≤16B | 95% | Near-instantaneous; vast power; strategic thinker |
| 5 | **Adept** | 0.6 sec (condensed) | 80%, p≤32B | 99% | Transcendent; reality-bending; legendary |

### Key Progression Mechanics

- **Magical Clarity Limit (MCL):** The maximum information transfer rate for a magic user — how precisely they can shape their spell. Increases with rank.
- **Magical Luck Limit (MLL):** The absolute ceiling on spell success probability, regardless of how many Laws are invoked. Even a perfect spell can fail.
- **Spell Condensation (AT Formula 9.1):** With practice (AT Table 9.1), a spell that takes 100 minutes uncondensed can eventually be cast in under a second. Higher rank = fewer repetitions needed to condense.
- **Psi Potential:** Innate psychic potential determines the *breadth* of talents available. Rank determines the *depth* of mastery.

### Evaluation Criteria

| # | Criterion | Fail | Pass | Excel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V-1 | **Qualitative rank changes**: Do higher ranks feel fundamentally different, not just numerically bigger? | +1 to hit per level | Unlocks new abilities at breakpoints | Each rank transforms casting speed, reliability ceiling, tapping access, and strategic options |
| V-2 | **Spell condensation**: Can practiced spells be cast faster than new ones? | No practice mechanic | Familiar spells slightly faster | Explicit condensation system: repetition compresses casting time by orders of magnitude |
| V-3 | **Hard limits**: Are there ceilings that cannot be exceeded, even by stacking bonuses? | No limits | General level cap | Specific limits: MLL caps success probability, MCL caps precision, Magical Power caps single-spell investment |
| V-4 | **Non-mage magic users**: Can characters outside the "wizard" class engage with magic meaningfully? | Only designated casters use magic | Use Magic Device-style feats | Three types of non-mages (Type A/B/C) with distinct capabilities and limitations (Greg Stafford, AT pp.141-142) |
| V-5 | **Rank affects everything**: Does advancement change the character's relationship with the entire magic system, not just add numbers? | Flat stat growth | Some new abilities | Rank modifies condensation time, tapping percentages, ether access quantities, MLL, MCL, new talent availability, and teaching capacity |

### Evolution Directives

- **ED-V-A:** Implement **five distinct ranks** with qualitative transformations at each threshold. Rank 3 (Master) should be the *minimum* for reliable combat magic; Rank 5 (Adept) should be world-shaping.
- **ED-V-B:** Build a **Spell Condensation** system where practiced spells progressively compress in casting time. Track repetitions per spell. First 5 repetitions at full time; condensation begins at repetition 5+ (AT Table 9.1).
- **ED-V-C:** Implement **hard limits** — Magical Luck Limit, Magical Clarity Limit, and Magical Power — that cannot be exceeded by stacking. This prevents the "god wizard at level 20" problem by ensuring that even the most powerful caster has a meaningful failure chance.
- **ED-V-D:** Create **Dying Curse** mechanics: when a magic user is killed, they may release 100% of remaining Magical Strength in a final curse against their attacker (AT Formula 9.5).

---

## PILLAR VI: THE DIVINE DIMENSION
### "The Gods Are Alive, Magic Is Afoot"

**Core Principle (AT pp.99-120):** Deities are not stat blocks. They are entities composed of living mana, shaped by the collective belief and worship of their followers across generations. The relationship between deity and worshipper is *reciprocal* — the deity gives blessings in exchange for mana generated through worship. This "Mount Olympus Savings & Loan" model means deities grow stronger with more worshippers and weaker when forgotten.

### Spirit Hierarchy (AT pp.100-107)

| Entity Type | MP Range | HP Range | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|
| **God/Goddess** | ~1 billion | ~1 billion | Vast, composed of pure mana, shaped by collective worship |
| **Godling/Demiurge** | ~1 million | ~1 million | Minor deity; regional power; can be created by sustained worship |
| **Faeries (Queen/King)** | 50,000-1,000,000+ | Similar | Walking Wild Mana Areas; godling-rank; all failures critical near them |
| **Nature Elementals (Chief)** | 1,000,000+ | Similar | Personification of classical elements; Gnomes, Undines, Salamanders, Sylphs, Sprites |
| **Nature Spirits** | 5-5,000 | Similar | Personification of natural features (trees, streams, rocks) |
| **Ancestors/Heroes** | Varies | Varies | Spirits of the dead; available on Astral/Mental/Spiritual Planes |
| **Demons** | ≤minor godling | Similar | Opposed spirits; always inferior to Gods of their mythology |
| **Artificial Elementals** | As created | As created | Psychic robots; magical devices with independence |

### Worship as Energy Exchange (AT pp.110-112)

The **Five Phases of Worship Ritual:**
1. **Starting the Rite:** Establish group mind; create sacred space/time
2. **Opening the Gates:** Prayers/invocations establish psychic link with deity
3. **Major Sending:** Mana raised and sent to deity (etheric → spiritual plane)
4. **Receiving Returned Power:** Deity sends back amplified mana for blessings/spells
5. **Unwinding:** Careful reversal; thanks; closing of gates; reaffirmation

### Evaluation Criteria

| # | Criterion | Fail | Pass | Excel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VI-1 | **Deities as living entities**: Are gods modeled as conscious mana patterns that grow and change? | Gods as stat blocks or plot devices | Gods have personality and preferences | Gods are living mana ecosystems; their power waxes/wanes with worship; they have desires, limitations, and relationships |
| VI-2 | **Reciprocal worship**: Is the deity-worshipper relationship a genuine energy exchange? | Cleric gets spells by divine fiat | Prayer/devotion mechanic | Full reciprocal system: worship generates mana, deity returns amplified power; Piety/State of Grace tracks the relationship |
| VI-3 | **Sleepy vs. Wide Awake deities**: Does the system distinguish between actively-worshipped and forgotten gods? | All deities equally available | Living vs. dead god distinction | Spectrum from Wide Awake (actively worshipped, easy to contact) to Sleeping (forgotten, hard to reach, unpredictable if roused) |
| VI-4 | **Head vs. Gut deities**: Do deities have different domains and personalities reflecting their cultural roles? | All gods functionally identical | Domain-specific deity powers | Head deities (intellect, art, wisdom) vs. Gut deities (combat, fertility, food) with distinct powers, personality, and relationship styles |
| VI-5 | **Spirit communication spectrum**: Are there multiple levels of divine contact, from subtle to dramatic? | Binary prayer/miracle | 2-3 contact levels | Full spectrum: Inspiration → Conversation → Channeling → Partial Possession → Full Possession, with increasing power and decreasing caster control |
| VI-6 | **Sacrifice as mana transfer**: Is sacrifice modeled as an actual energy exchange rather than a morality check? | No sacrifice mechanic | Offering gives flat bonus | Sacrifice releases the mana of the offering: apotropaic (to repel evil), propitiatory (to gain favor), thanksgiving, supportive; material and nonphysical forms |

### Evolution Directives

- **ED-VI-A:** Implement a **Deity Relationship System** with Piety (devotion stat) and State of Grace (current divine favor). Clerical magic effectiveness scales with these values.
- **ED-VI-B:** Model deities with **Wakefulness** — how many current worshippers feed them mana. Sleeping deities are unreliable; Wide Awake deities respond promptly.
- **ED-VI-C:** Create the **Five Phases of Worship** as a group ritual mechanic that generates collective mana, sends it to a deity, and receives amplified return power.
- **ED-VI-D:** Implement **Clerical Tapping** as deity-mediated: the Cleric requests mana from the deity, the deity rolls "reaction" (modified by Piety), and may send 1-10× the requested amount (or nothing, or a curse if Piety is low).

---

## PILLAR VII: MAGICAL DEVICES & PERSISTENT ENCHANTMENT
### "The Fastest Wand in the West"

**Core Principle (AT pp.89-98):** Magical devices are not "magic items with charges." They are astral constructions — energy patterns frozen in space-time around or within physical objects. Every device was once a freshly-cast spell. Devices come in degrees matching caster ranks, and they work by tapping, teaching, or triggering.

### Device Categories

| Type | Function | User Requirement | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tapping Devices** | Channel mana from sources through the user | Little to no Psi needed | Physically and psychically designed to draw mana |
| **Teaching Devices** | Teach the user a spell and help condense it | Minimal Psi Potential + requisite talents | Guide the user through the spell process |
| **Triggering Devices** | Contain entire spells; release under specific conditions | Thought-activated; some usable by anyone | Pre-built astral spell released by matching trigger condition |

### Device Degrees (AT pp.97)

| Degree | Minimum Maker Rank | User Psi Requirement | Spell Level | Rarity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1st | Rank 1 (Apprentice) | None-Low | Low (cantrips/wards) | Common |
| 2nd | Rank 2 (Journeyman) | Low | Low-Medium | Uncommon |
| 3rd | Rank 3 (Master) | Medium | Medium-High | Rare |
| 4th | Rank 4 (Magus) | Medium-High | High | Very Rare |
| 5th | Rank 5 (Adept) | High | Highest | Legendary |

### Key Concepts

- **Post-Hypnotic Props:** Most wands/rings are usable only by the magician who programmed themselves to use them. They're personal post-hypnotic cues, not universal "magic wands."
- **Spell Decay affects devices:** Older devices are weaker, their information fields degrading over time (AT Tables 8.5-8.7). Ancient artifacts are powerful because their makers were powerful enough to give them half-lives of millennia.
- **"Instant Amnesia" is stupid:** Bonewits specifically attacks the D&D rule that wizards forget spells after casting. Real magicians memorize massive amounts of lore; forgetting a practiced spell would be like forgetting how to ride a bicycle.

### Evaluation Criteria

| # | Criterion | Fail | Pass | Excel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VII-1 | **Devices as frozen processes**: Are magic items modeled as spell-processes attached to objects, not innate object properties? | Items "are" magical | Items "contain" charges | Items are astral spell-patterns attached to physical anchors, subject to decay, with specific trigger conditions |
| VII-2 | **Device creation as craft**: Can player characters create magical devices through a meaningful process? | No crafting | Simple crafting recipe | Degree-based crafting system requiring appropriate rank, talents, time, MPs, and physical materials |
| VII-3 | **Device decay**: Do magical items degrade over time? | Items last forever | Items have charges | Items have half-lives based on maker's rank; ancient items are weaker unless made by legendary artisans |
| VII-4 | **User requirements**: Do magic items require talent/training from the user? | Anyone can use anything | Class restrictions | Tiered requirements by degree; tapping devices need minimal psi, triggering devices need matching thought patterns |
| VII-5 | **Books and scrolls**: Is magical writing handled authentically (as notes/ciphers, not spell containers)? | Books contain spells to memorize | Books teach spells | Books are research notes in personal cipher; reading requires the right Psi talents and cultural knowledge; they don't "contain" spells, they describe processes |

### Evolution Directives

- **ED-VII-A:** Implement **Device Degrees** (1-5) matching caster ranks. A Rank 3 Master can make 3rd degree devices containing medium-to-high level spells.
- **ED-VII-B:** Create a **Device Decay** system: items have Probability of Spell Persistence (ProSPer) that decreases over time based on maker rank and Standard Time Units elapsed (AT Table 8.6).
- **ED-VII-C:** Model three device types — **Tapping** (channel external mana), **Teaching** (help user learn spells), and **Triggering** (release pre-built spells under specific conditions) — with distinct mechanics for each.
- **ED-VII-D:** Implement **Amulets, Talismans, and Magical Weapons** as distinct categories (amulets attract/repel by natural association; talismans are complete spell representations requiring contagion with user; weapons have pluses on damage and/or pluses on hits).

## COMPOSITE SCORING

### Protocol Compliance Rating

| Rating | Score | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **INAUTHENTIC** | 0-35 total Passes | System contradicts most AT principles; magic is essentially superpowers |
| **CONVENTIONAL** | 36-70 Passes | System follows some AT principles but relies on genre convention over authenticity |
| **AUTHENTIC** | 71-100 Passes | System substantially models AT principles; magic feels like real-world magical traditions |
| **MASTERWORK** | 101+ Passes (with Excels) | System fully implements AT principles with original extensions; Bonewits would approve |

### Quick Audit Checklist (The 12 Essential Questions)

1. Is magic a *process* or a *thing* in your system?
2. Can the same spell produce different results under different conditions?
3. Do more preparation/knowledge/associations = higher success chance?
4. Does mana come from identifiable sources with real costs?
5. Can magic fail in four distinct ways (Minor/Major/Disastrous/Total)?
6. Are there hard ceilings on success probability that cannot be stacked past?
7. Do higher ranks feel *qualitatively* different from lower ranks?
8. Are deities living entities that grow/shrink with worship, not stat blocks?
9. Can magic items decay over time?
10. Does the environment (mana density, ley-lines, sacred sites) affect magic?
11. Are there multiple cultural traditions (modalities) for the same underlying abilities?
12. Does anti-magic exist as its own discipline with distinct mechanics?

If you answered "yes" to all 12, your system is **Authentic**. If you answered "yes and here's how it's interesting," your system may be a **Masterwork**.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROTOCOL

### For Evaluation (Auditing an Existing System)

1. Read through each Pillar's Evaluation Criteria
2. Score each criterion as Fail (0), Pass (1), or Excel (2)
3. Sum scores per Pillar and overall
4. Note which criteria scored Fail — these are your system's authenticity gaps
5. Reference the corresponding Evolution Directives for specific fixes

### For Evolution (Upgrading an Existing System)

1. Complete the evaluation above to identify gaps
2. Prioritize Evolution Directives by impact (Pillar I and II changes are foundational)
3. Implement changes iteratively — start with ED-I-A (process over product) and ED-II-A (Law Invocation Checklist)
4. Playtest after each major change
5. Re-audit to measure improvement

### For Creation (Building a New System)

1. Begin with Pillar I — establish the foundational philosophy
2. Implement the Laws of Magic (Pillar II) as your core resolution mechanic
3. Design Psychic Talents (Pillar III) as the engine
4. Add Energetics (Pillar IV) for resource management
5. Layer in Progression (Pillar V) for character growth
6. Add Divine Dimension (Pillar VI) if your setting includes deities
7. Add Devices (Pillar VII) for persistent enchantment
8. Score yourself against all criteria; iterate until Authentic or better

## APPENDIX A: BONEWITS' SPELL RECIPE FORMAT

*(AT Table 9.2, p.92)*

Every spell should be documented on a **Spell Recipe Card** containing:

1. **Props:** Window-dressing, costumes, tools used
2. **Psychic Talents Used:** List each talent with probability increment (p.i.) and Base MP Cost
   - 2.1: List the p.i. for each talent used
   - 2.2: Star (*) flaired talents; add 10% to p.i.
   - 2.3: List Base Cost in MPs for each talent; total
3. **Laws of Magic:** List every Law invoked with p.i. per usage
   - 3.1: List the p.i. bonuses for each Law usage
4. **Other Probability Bonuses:** Specialty, experience, past success, mixed sources
5. **Total PoSS:** Sum all p.i. values (capped by Magical Luck Limit at rank)
6. **MP Formulas:** Additional MP costs (tapping, STU alteration, etc.)
7. **Total MP Cost:** Base + Task costs for different results/targets
8. **Casting Time:** In minutes; how condensed?
9. **Miscellaneous:** Range, Magical Clarity needed, tapping requirements
10. **Description:** What the caster actually *does* (words, movements, technique)
11. **History:** (Back of card) Record of each casting: field/home, conditions, result

---

## APPENDIX B: THE TEN-STEP SPELL CASTING PROCEDURE

*(AT Chapter 8, pp.75-76)*

1. **Determine the Target/Goal:** What are you trying to affect, and what result do you want?
2. **Gather Information:** Learn everything possible about the target (Law of Knowledge)
3. **Choose Psychic Talents:** Select which Psi Talents will accomplish the goal
4. **Design the Ritual:** Plan the casting procedure — props, words, movements, timing
5. **Invoke the Laws:** Deliberately apply as many Laws of Magic as possible
6. **Raise Mana:** Use appropriate technique(s) to generate necessary MPs
7. **Focus and Shape:** Direct the mana through the chosen Talents toward the target
8. **Release:** Send the shaped energy to accomplish the goal
9. **Evaluate:** Check for success/failure; monitor for decay
10. **Record:** Document the spell and its results for future reference
