# DICE GODZ NUMEROLOGY SYSTEM v1.0
## The Language of Numbers — Where Meaning Meets Mechanics

*Document Version: 1.0 — 2026-02-08*
*Companion to: DICE_GODZ_CHARACTER_CREATION_v3.1.md*
*Layers onto v3.1 as an additional mechanical and narrative system*

---

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

v3.1 teaches: **Senses → Mind → Intelligence → Wealth.** The numerology system extends this teaching into the numbers themselves: *every number speaks, and the player who listens gains advantage.*

In most RPGs, a roll of 3 on a D20 is simply "bad." The number 3 has no meaning beyond its position on a scale. Dice Godz says: the number 3 IS SOMETHING — it has a story, a resonance, a weight that depends on which element's die produced it and what cultural tradition you read it through.

This is the Intelligence layer (D100/Order) applied to the Sense layer (the 6 dice). When a player recognizes pattern and meaning in their rolls, they are performing the very progression the game teaches: using Intelligence to transform raw sensory data into wisdom.

**The Core Principle: Numerological Resonance**

When a player rolls a die and the result is mechanically low, the MEANING of the number can override its VALUE — if the player can articulate the resonance.

This is not a loophole. It is the game's deepest teaching expressed as a mechanic.

## PART I: THE BIRTH HEXAGRAM

### The Discovery

During the Godz World Egg, 6 dice are rolled per set. Each die produces a number either above or below its median. If we read each result as a binary line — yang (solid ⚊) if above median, yin (broken ⚋) if below — then each set of 6 dice produces a **6-line hexagram**, identical in structure to the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching (Yìjīng, 易經).

The Godz World Egg has been producing hexagrams all along. We just weren't reading them.

### How It Works

For each die in a GWE set, determine if the result is above or below the die's median:

| Die | Range | Median | Yin ⚋ (below) | Yang ⚊ (above) |
|-----|-------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| D4 (Fire) | 1–4 | 2.5 | 1–2 | 3–4 |
| D6 (Earth) | 1–6 | 3.5 | 1–3 | 4–6 |
| D8 (Air) | 1–8 | 4.5 | 1–4 | 5–8 |
| D10 (Chaos) | 1–10 | 5.5 | 1–5 | 6–10 |
| D12 (Ether) | 1–12 | 6.5 | 1–6 | 7–12 |
| D20 (Water) | 1–20 | 10.5 | 1–10 | 11–20 |

### The Six Lines

The 6 dice map to 6 hexagram lines, built bottom to top:

```
Line 6 (top)    : D20 Water   — The flow of empathy       (subtle)
Line 5          : D12 Ether   — The vibration of sound     (subtle)
Line 4          : D10 Chaos   — The fire of mind           (subtle)
─── ─── ─── ─── ─── (boundary between trigrams) ─── ─── ─── ─── ───
Line 3          : D8  Air     — The breath of strength     (material)
Line 2          : D6  Earth   — The ground of endurance    (material)
Line 1 (bottom) : D4  Fire    — The spark of sight         (material)
```

**Lower Trigram** (Lines 1–3: Fire, Earth, Air) = Your **Material Nature** — how your body and senses engage the physical world.

**Upper Trigram** (Lines 4–6: Chaos, Ether, Water) = Your **Subtle Nature** — how your mind, perception, and empathy engage the world beyond form.

### 8 × 8 = 64

Each trigram has 2³ = 8 possible states. With lower and upper trigrams independent:

**8 material states × 8 subtle states = 64 unique hexagrams**

This maps 1:1 to the **64 Gemstone Species of CryptoFae.**

- The **Lower Trigram** (material nature) determines the character's **Petal** — which of 8 elemental families they belong to.
- The **Upper Trigram** (subtle nature) determines the **Species** within that petal — which of 8 gemstone beings they are.

### The Eight Trigrams (Ba Gua) and TEK8

The 8 possible trigram states correspond to the 8 I Ching trigrams and to the 8 TEK8 elements:

| Binary | Trigram | Chinese Name | TEK8 Element | Meaning |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| ☰ 111 | Heaven | Qián (乾) | Order | Creative force, the pattern behind patterns |
| ☱ 110 | Lake | Duì (兌) | Ether | Joyous reflection, sound across water |
| ☲ 101 | Fire | Lí (離) | Fire | Clinging light, sight that illuminates |
| ☳ 100 | Thunder | Zhèn (震) | Chaos | Arousing shock, the mind that disrupts to transform |
| ☴ 011 | Wind | Xùn (巽) | Air | Gentle penetration, the breath that reaches everywhere |
| ☵ 010 | Water | Kǎn (坎) | Water | The abyss, depth, the danger and beauty of empathy |
| ☶ 001 | Mountain | Gèn (艮) | Earth | Keeping still, the ground that holds |
| ☷ 000 | Earth | Kūn (坤) | Coin | Receptive devotion, the field that receives all seeds |

### The Birth Hexagram

The **FINAL set** rolled in the GWE — the set that pushes the total past 360° — produces the character's **Birth Hexagram**. This hexagram:

1. **Determines the character's CryptoFae species.** The lower trigram picks the petal, the upper picks the species. This is not arbitrary choice — it is emergence.
2. **Connects the character to an I Ching hexagram** with its own ancient commentary text (the *Tuàn* 彖 and *Xiàng* 象 interpretations).
3. **Provides a creation narrative.** The hexagram's traditional meaning, interpreted through TEK8, becomes the character's origin myth.
4. **Can be read through multiple traditions** — not just Chinese. The hexagram structure appears in African Ifá divination (256 odù from 4 binary chains), in Leibniz's binary mathematics, in the DNA codon table (64 codons).

Players may still *choose* a species if they prefer — player agency always prevails. But the Birth Hexagram provides a suggested species: a resonance, not a requirement.

### The Creation Story

The SEQUENCE of hexagrams across all ~11 GWE sets tells the story of the character's creation. The first hexagram is the initial state. The last is the birth state. The journey between them is the cosmogonic myth of this particular being rolling itself into existence.

A player who records all 11 hexagrams has an **11-chapter creation narrative** interpretable through:
- The I Ching (each transition between hexagrams has traditional commentary)
- Pure pattern (which lines change? which elements shift from yin to yang?)
- Numerological meaning (what numbers drove the transitions?)

---

## PART II: PERSONAL RESONANCE NUMBERS

### How They Emerge

During the GWE, track the **mode** (most frequently rolled number) for each die across all sets:

**Example:** Over 11 sets, a player's D8 (Air) results were: 3, 7, 3, 5, 3, 1, 6, 3, 2, 8, 3
- Mode = 3 (rolled 5 times out of 11)
- This player's **Air Resonance Number** is **3**

Repeat for each of the 6 dice. If there is a tie, the player chooses which number to claim — this is itself a character-defining moment.

### The Six Personal Resonance Numbers

Each character emerges from the GWE with 6 resonance numbers, one per element:

| Element | Die | Range | Resonance Number = Mode of all GWE rolls on this die |
|---------|-----|-------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Fire | D4 | 1–4 | The number that Fire speaks to you through |
| Earth | D6 | 1–6 | The number that Earth speaks to you through |
| Air | D8 | 1–8 | The number that Air speaks to you through |
| Chaos | D10 | 1–10 | The number that Mind speaks to you through |
| Ether | D12 | 1–12 | The number that Sound speaks to you through |
| Water | D20 | 1–20 | The number that Empathy speaks to you through |

These numbers are **personal** — they emerge from your unique GWE data. No two characters are statistically likely to share the same set of six resonance numbers. They are your numerological fingerprint.

### Using Resonance Numbers in Play

**When you roll your Personal Resonance Number on a check using that element's die:**

Regardless of mechanical success or failure, the roll is treated as a **Resonant Success** — a partial success with narrative weight. The outcome may not be what you wanted, but it carries the truth of your elemental nature.

**Example:** Your Air Resonance Number is 3. You roll D8 for a Strength check and get 3. Mechanically, 3/8 = 37.5% attainment — not great. But because 3 is your Air Resonance, you narrate how your strength manifests in a way true to your nature — *not raw power, but the precise force of a focused breath.* The GM treats it as a partial success. You lift the gate, but not all the way — enough for the child to crawl through.

## PART III: THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF NUMBERS

### Cross-Cultural Numerological Meanings

Every number carries meaning across human traditions. The following draws from Vedic, Pythagorean, Chinese, Mayan, and Polynesian frameworks. These meanings are shared tools for narrative interpretation, not dogma — lenses, not laws.

#### The Primal Numbers (1–8) — One Per TEK8 Element

| Number | TEK8 Resonance | Sanskrit | Pythagorean | Cross-Cultural Essence |
|--------|---------------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **1** | Fire (Spark) | *Eka* — the one | Monad — unity, source | The beginning. Brahman. First light. The origin from which all numbers flow. |
| **2** | Coin (Duality) | *Dvi* — pair | Dyad — division, polarity | The first split. Flow/Scarcity. Give/Receive. The coin has two faces. |
| **3** | (Trinity) | *Tri* — three | Triad — creation, harmony | Creator-Preserver-Transformer. Three logs make a fire. The first pattern. |
| **4** | Fire Max (D4) | *Chatur* — four | Tetrad — stability, earth | Four directions. Four Vedas. Completion of the smallest cycle. The full flame. |
| **5** | (The Senses) | *Pancha* — five | Pentad — life, humanity | Five gross senses. Five fingers. Pancha Tattva. The human number. |
| **6** | Earth Max (D6) | *Shaṭ* — six | Hexad — beauty, harmony | Six faces of the cube. Hexagonal crystal. Star of David. Sacred geometry of earth. *Shri*. |
| **7** | (Mystery) | *Sapta* — seven | Heptad — spirit, depth | Seven chakras. Seven notes. Seven days. The number that resists division — the spiritual prime. |
| **8** | Air Max (D8) | *Aṣṭa* — eight | Ogdoad — regeneration | TEK8. Eight-fold noble path. Eight limbs of Ashtanga Yoga. Infinity rotated. |

#### The Extended Numbers (9–20)

| Number | Die Connection | Significance |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **9** | D10 near-max | Completion before renewal. Navagraha (9 celestial bodies). Enneagram. In Chaos, rolling 9 = the precipice before Willpower perfection. |
| **10** | D10 max | Dashavatara (10 avatars of Vishnu). Tetractys (1+2+3+4). The mind at its fullest — Chaos perfectly harnessed. |
| **11** | ~Average GWE sets | Master number in Western numerology. Gateway between worlds. The number of creation itself — approximately how many sets it takes to roll a being into existence. |
| **12** | D12 max | Cosmic order. 12 zodiac signs. 12 Jyotirlinga. 12 Olympians. 12 Imams. The Ether at its fullest — perfect Creativity. The cycle that sings. |
| **13** | Between D12 and D20 | Transformation. The 13th Tarot major arcana = Death/Rebirth. 13 lunar months. Liminal — it lives in no die's maximum. The threshold number. |
| **14–19** | Water's middle range | Each carries tradition-specific weight. 14 = Shiva's 14 worlds. 15 = Pancha-dasha (the fifteenth lunar day, full moon in Hindu calendar). 16 = the 16 kalas of the moon. 17 = Star card in Tarot, hope. 18 = Mahabharat's 18 books, 18 chapters of the Gita. 19 = the Sun card, vitality. |
| **20** | D20 max | Maya vigesimal base number. Judgment in Tarot. Water complete = perfect Empathy. The widest possible resonance. The full icosahedron. |

#### The Number 64

The number 64 appears as a marker of completeness across traditions:

| Tradition | Expression | Meaning |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Chinese | 64 Hexagrams (I Ching) | The complete map of change |
| Vedic | 64 Kalās | The 64 arts a complete person masters |
| Dice Godz | 64 Gemstone Species | All possible CryptoFae beings |
| Dice Godz | 64 Custom Skill Slots | Full skill capacity per character |
| Dice Godz | 64 Phenomena | Complete phenomenon set in CrySword SAGA |
| Mathematics | 2⁶ = 64 | All binary states of 6 variables — the GWE hexagram |
| Genetics | 64 codons | The complete genetic code (4³ base triplets) |
| Chess | 64 squares | The complete field of strategic play |

The convergence is not coincidence. 64 is the mathematical signature of "all possible states of 6 binary choices." In the GWE, 6 dice each contribute a yin or yang line. In DNA, 3 positions with 4 options each. In chess, 8×8. Different substrates, same combinatorial depth.

## PART IV: RESONANCE IN PLAY — THE MECHANIC

### The Resonance Declaration

When a player rolls a die and wishes to invoke numerological resonance:

**1. Declare:** *"I invoke resonance."*

**2. Narrate:** Explain WHY this number resonates with the current situation. Draw from any combination of:
- The number's cross-cultural meaning (Part III above)
- The element's TEK8 correspondence (sense, ability, opulence, virtue, capital)
- The character's personal story and history
- The specific situation at hand

**3. Adjudicate:** The table — not just the GM — considers whether the resonance rings true. If it does:
- A **mechanical failure** becomes a **narrative partial success**
- The character achieves something *related* to their intent, but through an unexpected channel
- The outcome should reflect the *number's meaning*, not merely the player's desire

### Three Tiers of Resonance

**Tier 1 — Universal Resonance** *(any player, any roll)*
Any player can invoke the cross-cultural meaning of any number. This costs nothing but must be narratively earned through genuine storytelling. A mechanical failure becomes a partial success.

**Tier 2 — Personal Resonance** *(your resonance number, your element's die)*
When you roll YOUR resonance number on the corresponding element's die, the resonance is automatic. No narration required (though always welcome). A failure becomes a partial success; a partial success becomes a full success.

**Tier 3 — Hexagram Resonance** *(Birth Hexagram match)*
If a scene involves rolling all 6 dice and the resulting hexagram matches your Birth Hexagram — this is a moment of cosmic alignment. The GM treats this as a significant story event. All checks in this scene succeed at their highest interpretation. The character is, for this moment, *exactly who they were born to be.*

*The odds of Tier 3: 1 in 64 per full set. Rare. And when it happens, the table will feel it.*

### Example: Resonance in Action

**Situation:** A character with Water Resonance Number 5 is trying to calm a panicked crowd (Empathy check, D20).

**Roll:** 5 on D20 = 25% attainment. Mechanically poor.

**Player declares Tier 2 Resonance** (Personal Resonance Number match): "5 is my Water number — the number of the five senses, the Pancha Tattva. My character doesn't overpower the crowd with a speech. She reaches out through all five senses simultaneously. She makes eye contact with the nearest person (sight), her voice drops to a low hum (sound), she extends an open palm (touch), she breathes in the same smoky air they breathe (smell), and she pulls out her waterskin and offers it to the closest child (taste). She doesn't command silence — she *connects*."

**Result (Tier 2 — automatic):** The crowd doesn't fully calm, but the nearest cluster stops pushing. A circle of stillness forms around the character and spreads outward. The panic doesn't end, but it has a center of gravity now. The partial success opens a path.

---

## PART V: NUMEROLOGY IN THE GWE

### Reading the Creation Rolls

Every GWE roll can be interpreted numerologically. This adds a **narrative layer** to character creation without changing a single mechanic from v3.1:

**During the GWE, after each set, the player (or another player reading for them) can interpret:**

- What does this combination of numbers say about this moment of creation?
- Which numbers repeat across dice? (Rolling 3 on D4, D6, AND D8 = the Triad echoing across all three material senses)
- What hexagram did this set produce? What is its I Ching meaning?
- How does this set's story relate to the previous set?

This turns character creation into a **divination ritual**. The dice ARE the oracle. The player is simultaneously creating a character and receiving a reading about that character's nature. This is not a metaphor — it is the oldest use of dice in human history. Dice were divination tools before they were game pieces.

### The Repeating Number

When the same number appears on multiple dice in a single GWE set:

| Count | Name | Significance |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 2 dice | **Echo** | That number carries extra weight in this set. Note it. |
| 3 dice | **Chorus** | That number is *singing*. The character has a deep affinity with it. It should appear in their story. |
| 4 dice | **Thunder** | Extremely rare. This number DEFINES the character. Consider incorporating it into their name, their guild number, their fate. |
| 5 dice | **Miracle** | Astronomically rare (varies by number, but generally < 0.1%). A table-level event. The number has chosen this character. |
| 6 dice | **All six show the same number** | Only possible if all dice show 1 (the only number in range of all 6 dice). This is rolling 1 on every die simultaneously. The probability is 1/(4×6×8×10×12×20) = 1/460,800. If this happens, the character is touched by the Monad itself. Something unprecedented enters the game. |

### Chorus Numbers and Character Identity

If a number achieves Chorus (3+ dice showing it) during any GWE set, it becomes a **Chorus Number** for that character — a number that resonates across multiple elements simultaneously. In gameplay, rolling a Chorus Number on ANY die grants Tier 1 resonance automatically (no narration required, though narration deepens the effect).

## PART VI: THE HEXAGRAM-SPECIES MAP

### 64 Hexagrams → 64 Gemstone Species

The exact mapping of hexagrams to Gemstone Species should be established as a reference table. The structural principle:

**Lower Trigram** (Lines 1–3: D4 Fire + D6 Earth + D8 Air) → **Petal**
- Determines which of the 8 elemental families the character belongs to
- This is the body's home, the material substrate

**Upper Trigram** (Lines 4–6: D10 Chaos + D12 Ether + D20 Water) → **Species**
- Determines which of 8 gemstone beings within that petal the character is
- This is the mind's home, the subtle identity

**Example Reading:**

A character's final GWE set:
- D4 Fire: rolled 3 (above median → Yang ⚊)
- D6 Earth: rolled 2 (below median → Yin ⚋)
- D8 Air: rolled 6 (above median → Yang ⚊)
- D10 Chaos: rolled 4 (below median → Yin ⚋)
- D12 Ether: rolled 9 (above median → Yang ⚊)
- D20 Water: rolled 7 (below median → Yin ⚋)

Lower Trigram (bottom to top): Yang-Yin-Yang = ☲ Lí (Fire)
Upper Trigram (bottom to top): Yin-Yang-Yin = ☵ Kǎn (Water)

Combined Hexagram: ☵ over ☲ = Hexagram 63, **Jì Jì (既濟) — "Already Fording" / "After Completion"**

The I Ching says of this hexagram: *"Success in small matters. Perseverance furthers. At the beginning good fortune, at the end disorder."* A character born under Already Fording begins in a state of achieved balance — but the teaching is that completion is the beginning of new challenge, not the end of effort.

The material nature (Fire trigram) and subtle nature (Water trigram) are in perfect complementary opposition. This character lives at the intersection of sight and empathy, agility and flow.

**Species:** Fire petal, Water-subtle species. *(The exact gemstone is determined by the DICE_GODZ_64_GEMSTONE_SPECIES mapping table.)*

### The Sequence of Hexagrams

Across ~11 GWE sets, the character accumulates ~11 hexagrams. This sequence can be read as:

1. **A creation epic** — 11 chapters, each with its own I Ching meaning
2. **A change pattern** — which lines change between sets? (In I Ching divination, changing lines indicate points of transformation)
3. **A developmental arc** — does the character move from receptive (many Yin) to active (many Yang)? From material-dominant (strong lower trigrams) to subtle-dominant (strong upper trigrams)?

### Changing Lines

Between any two consecutive GWE sets, some hexagram lines will change (a die that was above median in one set might be below in the next). In I Ching tradition, **changing lines** are the most significant part of a reading — they indicate WHERE transformation is happening.

If Fire (D4) changes from Yin to Yang between Set 3 and Set 4 of the GWE, it means: the character's Sight is awakening. Something is being ignited. This is the creation story at the most granular level.

## PART VII: INTEGRATION WITH v3.1 CHARACTER CREATION

### Where Numerology Attaches

The numerology system adds to v3.1 without modifying it:

| v3.1 Step | Numerology Addition |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Step 2: Roll the GWE** | After each set, optionally read the hexagram and number patterns |
| **Step 3: Calculate Composition** | Also calculate the mode for each die → Personal Resonance Numbers |
| **After Step 3** | Read the hexagram from the FINAL set → Birth Hexagram → Species suggestion |
| **Step 9: Species Selection** | Birth Hexagram suggests a species; player can accept or choose freely |
| **Ongoing Play** | Resonance Tiers 1–3 active during all checks |

## PART VIII: CULTURAL SHARING GUIDELINES FOR NUMEROLOGY

### What We Are Doing

This system draws from numerological and divinatory traditions spanning:
- **Vedic/Hindu** — Sanskrit number meanings, Navagraha, Kalās
- **Chinese** — I Ching hexagrams, lucky/unlucky associations, Ba Gua
- **Pythagorean Greek** — sacred geometry, the Monad through the Decad
- **Mesoamerican** — Maya vigesimal mathematics, the 13 tones, the 20 day signs of the Tzolk'in
- **West African** — Ifá divination system (256 odù from binary chains — parallel structure to hexagrams)
- **Polynesian** — Navigation mathematics, counting systems, spatial reasoning

We are not claiming mastery of these traditions. We are acknowledging that numbers carry meaning across human cultures, and that a game built on dice should honor that meaning rather than treat numbers as mere quantities.

### Guidelines for Players

1. **Research with respect.** If a number's cultural meaning intrigues you, seek primary sources from that tradition — not just what this game tells you. The I Ching has thousands of years of commentary. Read some of it.

2. **Name your sources.** When invoking a number's meaning at the table, say where the meaning comes from. *"In the Maya Tzolk'in, 13 represents..."* — not just *"13 means..."* Attribution is the minimum form of respect.

3. **Don't reduce to aesthetics.** The I Ching is a living philosophical and divinatory tradition used by billions of people. Ifá is a UNESCO-recognized masterpiece of oral heritage. These are not flavor texts. If you engage with them through this game, engage seriously enough to know what you are engaging with.

4. **Reciprocity applies.** If a tradition's number system enriches your gameplay, find a way to give back. Buy a book written by a practitioner. Support a cultural institution. Learn more than the game requires. This IS the Wealth mechanic: Flow requires reciprocity.

5. **The game is a doorway, not a destination.** Dice Godz numerology points toward traditions that have spent centuries mapping the meaning of number, pattern, and change. The game gives you a taste. The traditions are the meal.

## APPENDIX: THE MATHEMATICS OF RESONANCE

### Probability of Personal Resonance in Play

How often will a player roll their resonance number?

| Die | Range | Probability per roll |
|-----|-------|---------------------|
| D4 | 1–4 | 25% (1 in 4) |
| D6 | 1–6 | 16.7% (1 in 6) |
| D8 | 1–8 | 12.5% (1 in 8) |
| D10 | 1–10 | 10% (1 in 10) |
| D12 | 1–12 | 8.3% (1 in 12) |
| D20 | 1–20 | 5% (1 in 20) |

Personal Resonance is most common on Fire (D4) and rarest on Water (D20). This is philosophically correct: Fire is the most immediate sense (sight), and its resonance comes easily. Water is the deepest sense (empathy), and its resonance must be earned through patience.

### Probability of Hexagram Match (Tier 3)

Any given set of 6 dice has a 1/64 chance of producing a specific hexagram = **1.5625%** per full set of 6 dice rolled together. Over a typical session with, say, 10 full-set rolls, the cumulative probability of at least one Tier 3 event is approximately:

1 - (63/64)^10 ≈ **14.5%**

Rare enough to be special. Common enough that every player will experience it eventually.
