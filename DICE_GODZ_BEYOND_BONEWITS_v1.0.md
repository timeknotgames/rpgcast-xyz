# BEYOND BONEWITS: World Wisdom Traditions & Global Game Design for Dice Godz
## A Critical Reassessment and New Directions Toward v3.1

*Document Version: 1.0 — 2026-02-08*
*Supersedes: BONEWITS_THAUMATURGY_PROTOCOL_v1.0.md as sole design authority*

---

## PART I: WHY BONEWITS IS NOT ENOUGH

### 1.1 Who Was Bonewits?

Isaac Bonewits (1949-2010) was a Bay Area counterculture figure who earned a self-designed BA in "Magic" from UC Berkeley in 1970 by combining anthropology, sociology, psychology, and folklore. He was a Neopagan practitioner (Reformed Druids, Wicca, OTO), founder of the Druid organization ADF, and author of *Real Magic* (1971) and *Authentic Thaumaturgy* (1st ed. 1978, 2nd ed. 1998/2005, Steve Jackson Games).

He was not an academic anthropologist, historian of religion, or game designer by training. He was a practitioner-advocate writing from a combative Neopagan position. In 2019, ADF formally repudiated him as founder following abuse allegations.

### 1.2 What He Got Right

- Magic should be treated as a *process*, not a button press
- Energy must come from somewhere and go somewhere (TANSTAAFL)
- RPG magic systems should have internal consistency and real constraints
- Multiple magical modalities should coexist (not just "wizard")
- Spell failure should be granular, not binary

These insights remain valid. They are also not unique to Bonewits.

### 1.3 What He Got Wrong (Or Left Out)

**His "Laws of Magic" are not original.** They synthesize James George Frazer's *The Golden Bough* (1890) — Laws of Similarity and Contagion — with Edward Tylor's evolutionary anthropology, Golden Dawn ceremonial magic, and Margaret Murray's *discredited* witch-cult hypothesis. None of these sources are cited critically.

**His framework simulates only his own beliefs.** RPGnet's review calls it "more a soapbox for Bonewits' views than a gaming supplement." The *Refereeing and Reflection* review identifies that Bonewits has "a highly developed personal ideology of what magic is and isn't" and is "personally offended by different ideas in the field."

**He left out most of the world:**
- No Vedic/Hindu systems (despite their extraordinary rigor and depth)
- No Buddhist meditation/jhana tradition
- No Polynesian mana on its own terms (only the Westernized version)
- No African/Yoruba ase/ifa traditions
- No Indigenous American traditions
- No Daoist qi/wu wei
- No Sufi maqamat
- No Mesoamerican tonalli/teyolia/ihiyotl
- No Celtic three cauldrons (despite claiming Druidic lineage)

**He taxonomizes non-Western practices into Western categories** rather than engaging with them on their own terms. This is epistemic colonialism — the assumption that Western analytical categories are the proper framework for understanding all human spiritual practice.

### 1.4 The Colonialism of "Universal Laws"

The intellectual genealogy: Tylor (1871) → Frazer (1890) → Eliade (mid-20th c.) → Bonewits (1971-2005). Each step inherited the assumption that diverse global practices can be reduced to a single Western taxonomy.

For a game that draws from Vedic opulences, Polynesian mana, Celtic sovereignty, and TEK8's 8-element cosmology, Bonewits' taxonomy is not just inadequate but **actively counterproductive**: it forces diverse ontologies into one framework, stripping the cultural context that gives them meaning.

### 1.5 What Has Changed Since 1978/2005

- The Forge and indie RPG revolution (GNS theory, "System Does Matter")
- Story games and Belonging Outside Belonging
- Safety tools (X-Card, Lines and Veils)
- The decolonization movement in game design
- Indigenous-designed TTRPGs (Coyote & Crow, Ehdrigohr, Kaona, Tipua)
- Non-Western RPG traditions now visible globally (Japanese scene systems, Chinese jubensha, #RPGSEA, Afrofuturist settings)

### 1.6 Verdict for Dice Godz

**Keep from Bonewits:** The principle that magic has real costs, real constraints, and real consequences. The idea that spell failure should be granular. The emphasis on multiple magical modalities.

**Discard from Bonewits:** The "universal laws" taxonomy. The 9 generic stats (INT, WIS, STR, etc.). The Western-operator-manipulates-forces model. The assumption that one man's 1978 Neopagan framework is sufficient to authenticate a multicultural game.

**Replace with:** The game's own existing wisdom — the TEK8 8-element system, the Six Opulences of Bhagavan, the 8 Abilities, the Karma → OP pipeline — supplemented by respectful engagement with the specific traditions the game draws from.

## PART II: WHAT THE WORLD'S TRADITIONS OFFER DICE GODZ

### 2.1 Vedic/Hindu — The Foundation Already in the Game

The Six Opulences (*Bhaga* of *Bhagavan*, Vishnu Purana 6.5.74) are ALREADY the attribute system. Dice Godz doesn't need Bonewits to authenticate them — they come from one of the world's oldest and most rigorous philosophical traditions.

**Additional Vedic frameworks for v3.1:**

| Framework | Source | Game Application |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Three Gunas** (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas) | Bhagavad Gita ch.14, 17 | Dynamic state system — your current guna balance determines available abilities, NPC reactions, perception. Diet, time, actions shift the balance. |
| **Chakra System** (7 centers) | Sat-Cakra-Nirupana (c.1577) | Progression that is NOT linear — blockages at any center create specific dysfunctions. A powerful Manipura with blocked Anahata = tyrant. |
| **64 Kalas** (arts/skills) | Kama Sutra 1.3.15 | Already mapped 1:1 with 64 Gemstone Species. The kalas include singing, painting, architecture, gem-setting, rhetoric — not just combat skills. |
| **Ayurvedic Doshas** (Vata/Pitta/Kapha) | Caraka Samhita | Character creation based on constitutional type rather than class. Healing = restoring balance, not refilling a bar. |

**Key insight:** *Vairagya* (Renunciation) as a primary stat inverts Western RPG logic. The most powerful character is the one who has *relinquished* the most. This is antithetical to loot-accumulation design and is one of the most radical things about Dice Godz.

### 2.2 Polynesian/Pacific — Mana Reclaimed

The Western RPG "mana bar" is a drastic distortion. The original Polynesian concept (documented by Codrington, 1891; analyzed by Keesing, 1984) is:

- **Relational, not quantitative.** You don't "have 50 mana." You have mana *in relation to* specific domains. A chief has mana in governance; a fisherman at sea.
- **Proven by results.** Mana is demonstrated by outcomes. If your ritual fails, you didn't have sufficient mana. This is empirical.
- **Inherited AND earned.** Flows through genealogy (whakapapa) but must be maintained through successful action.
- **Contagious and transferable.** Objects, places, and people who have demonstrated efficacy carry mana.

**For Dice Godz v3.1:** Mana should be a reputation-like stat that increases through SUCCESS and decreases through FAILURE. It is not "spent" — it is *risked*. This transforms the entire mana economy from "blue bar management" to a gambling-like risk/reward dynamic.

**Tapu/Noa system:** High-tapu characters, objects, and locations are powerful but dangerous. Interacting with tapu things without proper standing causes harm. Characters must manage their own tapu status — becoming tapu for battle gives power but restricts social interaction.

**Whakapapa (genealogy as power):** Your character's power comes from ancestral connections. Reciting your whakapapa *literally empowers you*. The more complete your knowledge of your lineage, the more spiritual resources you access.

*Sources: Codrington, The Melanesians (1891); Shore, "Mana and Tapu" (1989); Keesing, "Rethinking Mana" (1984); Barlow, Tikanga Whakaaro (1991); Pukui et al., Nana I Ke Kumu (1972-79)*

### 2.3 Hawaiian — The Game's Own Aloha

Given the user's "Mahalo nui loa" and the connection to Hawaiian culture, specific Hawaiian concepts deserve integration:

- **'Uhane / 'Unihipili / 'Aumakua:** Three-self model (conscious mind / body-spirit / ancestral higher self). Prayer works through the 'unihipili to reach the 'aumakua.
- **Ha (breath/life force):** Contained within *Aloha*. Sharing breath (*honi*) is literal exchange of life force. Maps directly to mana-raising techniques.
- **Lokahi (harmony):** The Lokahi Wheel (six domains of wellness) is used in the Hawaiian TTRPG **Kaona** (2024, by Kanaka Maoli developers at Theorycraftist Games). Collaborative gameplay fosters problem-solving and community-building.

*Sources: Pukui, Haertig, Lee, Nana I Ke Kumu vols. 1-2 (1972-79); Kame'eleihiwa, Native Land and Foreign Desires (1992); Kaona game, CHI Play 2024*

### 2.4 Yoruba/African — Ase, Ubuntu, and Ifa

**Ase (vital force):** Everything possesses ase — rocks, words, herbs, songs. The universe is saturated with potential. Ase is activated through *correct combination*: right herb + right incantation + right time + right person. Missing any component reduces the effect.

**Orisa alignment:** Instead of generic stats, each character resonates with specific Orisa (deities as concentrations of ase in specific domains). This isn't worship — it's vibrational affinity. Maps naturally to TEK8's elemental guild system.

**Ubuntu ("a person is a person through other persons"):** Character abilities are literally determined by community bonds. A character alone has minimal capabilities. Each meaningful relationship adds to effective power. Losing a community member diminishes who the character IS.

**Ifa divination as resolution:** 256 odu (figures), each containing narrative verses. Instead of "success/failure," the resolution generates a *specific narrative situation* with associated stories and prescriptions. The result always includes "what to do next."

*Sources: Abimbola, Ifa: An Exposition (1976); Idowu, Olodumare (1962); Mbiti, African Religions and Philosophy (1969); Bascom, Ifa Divination (1969)*

### 2.5 Buddhist — Generosity as Advancement

**The Paramitas (Perfections):** The six Mahayana perfections offer a progression system where:
- **Dana (Generosity):** GIVING AWAY resources is how you level up. Complete inversion of loot design.
- **Kshanti (Patience):** Enduring harm without retaliation = advancement.
- **Prajna (Wisdom):** Seeing through illusion, understanding emptiness.

**Dependent Origination:** Every action creates karmic formations that condition future states. This is not a "good/evil karma meter" but a complex web of causation. Death is NOT failure — it's link 12, cycling back to link 1.

**The Jhanas as power tiers:** Deepening states of concentration that unlock specific abilities — but these powers are explicitly described as DISTRACTIONS from the actual goal (liberation). The "win condition" is dissolution of the player-character.

*Sources: Bodhi, Connected Discourses (2000); Gethin, Foundations of Buddhism (1998); Buddhaghosa, Visuddhimagga (5th c. CE)*

### 2.6 Daoist — Wu Wei and the Yijing

**Wu Wei (effortless action):** Actions taken "with the grain" cost less and accomplish more. Overaction degrades the situation. "Doing nothing" is mechanically valid and sometimes optimal. This challenges the fundamental RPG assumption that MORE action = MORE effectiveness.

**Qi Cultivation (Jing → Qi → Shen):** Three resources refined upward. Converting jing to qi depletes the physical to enhance the energetic. The refinement is irreversible — meaningful trade-offs at every stage.

**Yijing as resolution:** 64 hexagrams (!) providing not just outcomes but *trajectories* — where you are, where you're going, and what to do about it. The 64 hexagrams map naturally to the 64 Gemstone Species.

*Sources: Laozi, Dao De Jing; Zhuangzi; Slingerland, Effortless Action (2003); Wilhelm, I Ching (1950); Kohn, Daoism and Chinese Culture (2001)*

### 2.7 Celtic/Irish — The Three Cauldrons

**Coire Goiriath / Coire Ermai / Coire Sofhis:** Three internal cauldrons (belly/chest/head) governing vitality, vocation, and wisdom. The Cauldron of Motion is turned by intense experience (joy OR sorrow). The Cauldron of Wisdom can ONLY be turned by transcendent experience. Advancement requires NARRATIVE EVENTS, not XP.

**Imbas Forosnai (illuminating knowledge):** Divine inspiration that *arrives* rather than being *sent*. Three distinct divination methods with different costs and preparations.

**Firinne (truth as cosmic force):** A truthful ruler's kingdom literally thrives. An unjust ruler's land decays. Not a morality system — cosmic mechanics. Maps to Rainbow Roads territory health.

**Sovereignty Cycle:** The ruler is married to the land. Political power is inseparable from ecological/spiritual relationship.

*Sources: Breatnach, "The Caldron of Poesy" in Eriu 32 (1981); Kelly, Guide to Early Irish Law (1988); Nagy, Wisdom of the Outlaw (1985)*

### 2.8 Mesoamerican/Nahua — Three Souls and Cosmic Reciprocity

**Tonalli / Teyolia / Ihiyotl:** Three soul-forces (head/heart/liver). Most radical: ihiyotl (liver-breath) as *involuntary emanation*. Strong negative emotions literally become an area-of-effect hazard that damages those nearby. Emotional dysregulation has tactical consequences.

**Teotl (sacred dynamic energy):** Not "gods" but a unitary, ever-moving force expressing itself through complementary opposites. The cosmos is a process, not a collection of objects.

**Reciprocity with the cosmos:** Humans exist in a web of reciprocal obligation. Resource extraction without reciprocity depletes the world. The game world itself requires maintenance through player action.

**Tonalpohualli (260-day calendar):** 20 day-signs × 13 numbers = 260 unique birth-fate combinations. Far more granular than Western zodiac.

*Sources: Lopez Austin, Cuerpo humano e ideologia (1980); Maffie, Aztec Philosophy (2014); Leon-Portilla, Aztec Thought and Culture (1963)*

### 2.9 Sufi/Islamic — The 99 Names and Spiritual Stations

**The 99 Names as attributes:** Each Name represents a domain of divine quality that the character learns to embody. Advancing in a Name creates ethical constraints — cultivating Ar-Rahman makes you incapable of unnecessary cruelty. Power and ethics grow together.

**Maqamat (stations):** Stable progression earned through effort. But *ahwal* (states) are unpredictable gifts of grace. Dual progression: one track of stable advancement + one of unpredictable divine intervention.

**Kashf (unveiling):** Perception that reveals hidden layers of reality — not "detect magic" but perceiving the *meaning* behind things.

*Sources: Al-Ghazali, The Ninety-Nine Beautiful Names; Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam (1975); Chittick, The Sufi Path of Knowledge (1989)*

## PART III: WHAT INDIGENOUS GAME DESIGNERS ARE ACTUALLY DOING

### 3.1 Key Games and Designers

| Game | Designer | Tradition | Key Innovation |
|------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Coyote & Crow** (2021) | Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation) | Indigenous American | "Indigipunk" — no d20, no "magic" (word deliberately avoided), Body/Mind/Soul triple damage tracks, spiritual dimension given mechanical parity |
| **Ehdrigohr** (2013) | Allen Turner (Black/Lakota/Irish) | Lakota-inspired | "Mysteries" not "magic," cooperative storytelling, Graces/Sorrows dice, character phases map to life stages |
| **Dog Eat Dog** (2012) | Liam Liwanag Burke (Native Hawaiian / Filipino) | Pacific colonialism | Colonialism as core mechanic — wealthiest real-life player must play the colonizer |
| **Tipua** (2024) | 4Phase Aotearoa (Morgana Watson) | Maori | First Maori TTRPG, extensive kupu Maori, designs from whakairo (carving) |
| **Kaona** (2024) | Theorycraftist Games (Kanaka Maoli) | Hawaiian | Lokahi Wheel wellness domains, collaborative quests, mo'olelo (stories) as game structure |
| **Earth Mother, Sky Father** | Riwhi Kenny (Maori) | Maori | Two-player game embodying Ranginui and Papatuanuku |
| **Nahual** | Miguel Angel Espinoza (Mexican) | Nahua/Mexican | Shapeshifting nahuales, hunting *angels* (not demons), inverted Western morality |
| **Wagadu Chronicles** | Allan Cudicio (half-Ghanaian) | Pan-African | Lineages not races, ancestor spirits, non-lethal resource gathering |
| **Swordsfall** | Brandon Dixon | Afrofuturist | World where colonialism never happened, "Afropunk" as genre |

### 3.2 Eight Design Principles from Indigenous/Non-Western Games

1. **Cooperation over conquest.** Nearly every Indigenous TTRPG replaces extraction with community-building.
2. **Holistic character models.** Physical, mental, spiritual, and social dimensions given mechanical parity. (Coyote & Crow: Body/Mind/Soul tracks.)
3. **"The mechanic is the message."** (Elizabeth LaPensee, Anishinaabe) — Mechanics encode values, not just simulate physics.
4. **Shared narrative authority.** The "tyranny of the narrator" is rejected.
5. **Sovereign development.** Indigenous people must control their own representation from concept through distribution.
6. **Refuse to flatten diversity.** Connor Alexander deliberately avoids defining "magic" because doing so excludes nations with different traditions.
7. **Land as relationship, not resource.** Game spaces model ecological relationships.
8. **Goal-based, not level-based advancement.** Progress measured by personal and communal growth.

### 3.3 The Japanese Alternative

Japan's TTRPG tradition offers structural innovations unknown in the West:

| Innovation | Game | Principle |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| **Karma/Fate system** | Tenra Bansho Zero | Power increases Karma; at 108 (Buddhist number), you become a monster. Only way to reduce Karma = emotional resolution. Forgiving > killing. |
| **Encroachment Rate** | Double Cross | Using powers threatens your humanity. Anchor relationships ("Loises") pull you back. Sacrificing relationships grants massive power but at the cost of your soul. |
| **Diceless, relationship-powered** | Golden Sky Stories | No randomness. Power literally comes from social bonds. |
| **Travel, not combat** | Ryuutama | "Miyazaki's Oregon Trail." Players are farmers and merchants, not heroes. The GM plays a dragon-spirit who *records* the journey. |
| **Scene system** | Tokyo NOVA (F.E.A.R.) | Play broken into discrete scenes featuring 1-2 players; everyone must make at least one check per scene. Cinematic structure. |

### 3.4 The Wuxia Alternative

Chinese wuxia RPGs offer attribute systems rooted in the Five Elements (Wu Xing):

- **Qin: The Warring States** — Metal (martial), Wood (intelligence), Water (physical), Fire (charisma), Earth (intuition/mystical)
- **Legends of the Wulin** — Four damage tracks: Flesh, Qi, Mind, Passions. Battle is won through physical, spiritual, intellectual, AND emotional mastery.

## PART IV: WHAT THIS MEANS FOR DICE GODZ v3.1

### 4.1 The Core Realization

Dice Godz already had a more authentic and radical design than anything Bonewits could offer. The TEK8 system with its 8 Abilities, 6 Opulences, elemental senses, and Karma → OP pipeline is:

- **More culturally grounded** than Bonewits' Laws (rooted in Vedic philosophy, not Victorian anthropology)
- **More structurally original** than D&D stats (8 elements × 8 layers of correspondence)
- **More philosophically radical** than any Western RPG (Renunciation as power, Wealth as soul quality)
- **Already aligned** with what Indigenous game designers are calling for (holistic character models, relational mechanics, land-as-relationship)

### 4.2 The Eight Abilities — Already Better Than Bonewits' Stats

```
THE EIGHT ABILITIES (TEK8 Lotus — Original System)
  Creativity    — Ether (D12)  — Sound   — The capacity to bring forth the new
  Strength      — Air (D8)     — Touch   — The power to sustain
  Agility       — Fire (D4)    — Sight   — The quickness to respond
  Empathy       — Water (D20)  — Taste   — The depth to feel with others
  Endurance     — Earth (D6)   — Smell   — The rootedness to persist
  Willpower     — Chaos (D10)  — Mind    — The force to resist and transform
  Focus         — Order (D100) — Intelligence — The precision to see patterns
  Instinct      — Coin (D2)    — Ownership — The gut knowing beyond reason
```

These are 8 complete stats, each mapped to an element, a die, a sense, and a deeper meaning. They need no Bonewits supplement.

### 4.3 The Six Opulences — The Soul Layer

```
THE SIX OPULENCES (Bhaga of Bhagavan — Vishnu Purana 6.5.74)
  Strength      (Bala)      — Air    — The power to sustain
  Beauty        (Shri)      — Fire   — The radiance that compels
  Fame          (Yashas)    — Ether  — The echo of your deeds
  Knowledge     (Jnana)     — Order  — Direct perception of truth
  Wealth        (Aishvarya) — Coin   — The flow of abundance
  Renunciation  (Vairagya)  — Chaos  — Freedom from attachment

  Water (D20)  — [Community-discoverable — the opulence of Empathy?]
  Earth (D6)   — [Community-discoverable — the opulence of Foundation?]
```

The 6 Opulences are distributed via the Karma → OP pipeline. The two unassigned opulences remain open for community discovery, consistent with the Modular Species Framework's governance model.

### 4.4 Twelve Insights from World Traditions for v3.1

| # | Insight | Source Tradition | Application in Dice Godz |
|---|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | **Mana is proven by results, not spent as fuel** | Polynesian | Mana increases through success, decreases through failure. Risk-based, not expenditure-based. |
| 2 | **Renunciation as the highest power** | Vedic (Vairagya) | Already in the system. Protect and deepen it. |
| 3 | **Generosity as advancement** | Buddhist (Dana) | Giving away gemstones/resources levels you up. Hoarding stagnates you. |
| 4 | **Emotional dysregulation as area-of-effect hazard** | Nahua (Ihiyotl) | Uncontrolled negative emotions damage nearby allies. Emotional cultivation is tactical. |
| 5 | **Wu wei — inaction as optimal play** | Daoist | Overaction degrades situations. Waiting for the right moment is mechanically rewarded. |
| 6 | **Three Cauldrons — advancement through lived experience** | Celtic | Character growth requires narrative events (joy or sorrow), not XP accumulation. |
| 7 | **Community as literal power source** | Yoruba (Ubuntu), Polynesian (Whakapapa) | Character abilities are enhanced by relationships. Isolation weakens. |
| 8 | **The land requires reciprocity** | Nahua (Teotl), Celtic (Firinne) | Rainbow Roads territories have needs. Neglecting them causes decay. Extraction without reciprocity depletes the world. |
| 9 | **64 hexagrams ↔ 64 gemstones** | Daoist (Yijing) | The existing 64-fold symmetry maps to the Yijing's 64 hexagrams. Each gemstone species could correspond to a hexagram — providing not just identity but *trajectory*. |
| 10 | **Holistic damage tracks** | Japanese (Tenra Bansho Zero), Wuxia (Legends of the Wulin) | Body, Mind, Soul (or Flesh, Qi, Mind, Passion) as separate damage pools. Spiritual combat is as real as physical. |
| 11 | **Tapu/Noa as power management** | Polynesian | Characters manage sacred/ordinary status. Becoming tapu grants power but restricts social interaction. |
| 12 | **The mechanic is the message** | Indigenous game design (LaPensee) | Every mechanical choice encodes values. The Karma → OP → Opulence pipeline already does this. Don't replace it with generic systems that encode nothing. |

### 4.5 What v3.1 Should Look Like

**Layer 1 — The Eight Abilities** (TEK8 Lotus, one per element)
Derived from GWE elemental composition. These are what your element DOES.

**Layer 2 — The Six Opulences** (Bhagavan, distributed via Karma → OP)
These are who you ARE as a soul. Two remain community-discoverable.

**Layer 3 — Magical Statistics** (derived FROM Abilities and Opulences, not separate)
- Magical Strength = f(Strength_ability, Knowledge_opulence, Endurance_ability)
- Magical Power = 10% × Magical Strength
- Mana regeneration enhanced by Renunciation (detachment clears channels)
- PoSS modifiers from Opulence scores and elemental resonance

**Layer 4 — Relational Power** (inspired by Polynesian, Yoruba, Indigenous traditions)
- Mana proven by outcomes, not spent as fuel
- Community bonds enhance capabilities (ubuntu principle)
- Ancestral/whakapapa connections as power source (CryptoFae lineage)
- Territory health depends on reciprocity (firinne/teotl principle)

**Layer 5 — The Dynamic State** (inspired by Gunas, Tapu/Noa, Ihiyotl)
- Guna balance (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas) shifts based on actions, diet, time, environment
- Tapu/Noa status management
- Emotional emanation (ihiyotl) — uncontrolled passion damages area around character

**What gets preserved from Bonewits:**
- The *principle* that magic has real costs and real consequences
- Multiple magical modalities (not just "wizard")
- Spell failure granularity (four types)
- The idea that practice compresses casting time (condensation)

**What gets discarded from Bonewits:**
- The 9 generic stats (STR, INT, WIS, etc.)
- The "universal laws" taxonomy
- The operator-manipulates-forces model
- The assumption that one Western occultist's framework authenticates all magic

## CONCLUSION

Bonewits' *Authentic Thaumaturgy* is one man's attempt to systematize magic for RPGs from a Western Neopagan perspective circa 1978. It has useful principles but cannot serve as the sole authority for a game that draws from Vedic, Polynesian, Celtic, and Indigenous traditions.

The deepest irony: **Dice Godz was already more authentic than Bonewits.** The Six Opulences of Bhagavan, the 8 TEK8 Abilities, the Karma → OP pipeline, the 64 Gemstone Species — these are rooted in living traditions with millennia of philosophical depth. Applying Bonewits' protocol to them was like measuring a forest by the length of your yardstick.

v3.1 should restore what was there, deepen it with respectful engagement with the traditions the game draws from, and let Bonewits' useful principles serve as one voice among many — not the judge, jury, and protocol.

The most authentic magic system is the one that comes from the traditions the game was born from. Dice Godz was born from the Bhagavad Gita, from Varaha Lila, from TEK8's 8-element cosmos, from Hawaiian aloha, from the mana of the Pacific. That's where the magic lives.
