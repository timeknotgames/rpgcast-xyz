## CAMPAIGN PITCH (For Kickstarter Page)

### The One-Liner
**Dice Godz** is a tabletop RPG where character creation IS the game — roll 6 dice into existence across 11 ritual rounds, discover your species through I Ching hexagrams, read your birth sky through 40+ cultural star maps, and enter a world where the meaning of numbers matters as much as their value.

### The Elevator Pitch
What if your RPG's character creation was a Vedic cosmogonic ritual? What if your dice rolls produced I Ching hexagrams that determined your species? What if you could look up your character's birth sky through Polynesian, Vedic, Chinese, and Western astrology simultaneously using a free open-source planetarium? What if a "low roll" could become a success because you understood what the number *meant*?

**Dice Godz** is a pluriversal RPG built on TEK8 — an 8-element system drawn from Traditional Ecological Knowledge, Vedic philosophy, and the radical idea that no single cultural lens holds the whole truth. You need 6 dice (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20) and the willingness to take numbers seriously.

### Why This Is Different

- **No stat blocks from D&D.** Characters have the Six Opulences of Bhagavan (Strength, Beauty, Fame, Knowledge, Wealth, Renunciation) — Sanskrit philosophical categories, not body measurements.
- **2 of your 8 stats are emergent.** You don't roll Intelligence (D100) or Wealth (D2). They emerge from how you roll and how you play.
- **Species selection through divination.** Your final dice roll produces a hexagram. The hexagram determines your CryptoFae species from 64 possibilities.
- **Numerological resonance.** A "bad roll" whose number has cultural significance can become a partial success if you narrate the connection.
- **Pluriversal astrology.** Your character's birth sky is readable through 40+ cultural traditions via Stellarium (free, open-source).
- **No dice monoculture.** All 8 dice are equal. The attainment system (roll/die_max) ensures a D4 character is as viable as a D20 character.

---

### PART I: THE WORLD (Pages 3–10)

**Pages 3–4: What Is the Quillverse?**
- The shared setting: Earth, the digital realm, the Saraswati Supercluster, and the connections between them
- The CryptoFae: 64 species of gemstone beings
- The TEK8 system: 8 elements, 8 dice, 8 guilds
- The Rainbow Roads: 40 territories
- This is NOT a medieval fantasy. This is a game about mining, migration, stars, and the commons.

**Pages 5–6: The Eight Elements**
- The TEK8 Lotus — the full correspondence table:
  - Element → Dice → Shape → Sense → Ability → Opulence → Virtue → Capital → Wellness
- Why 8: the eight-fold path, the eight limbs of yoga, the octave, the eight directions
- No element is better or worse. Polyculture, not monoculture.

**Pages 7–8: The Eight Guilds**
- One guild per element, each with a philosophy, a role, and a home territory
- Guild membership is determined by dominant element after the GWE
- Players can shift guilds through gameplay as their elemental composition evolves

**Pages 9–10: The 64 Gemstone Species**
- Overview: 8 petals × 8 species = 64 CryptoFae
- Quick reference grid: species name, element, primary trait
- Species are determined by Birth Hexagram (see Character Creation) or player choice
- The 7 boundary species (Turquoise, Obsidian, Emerald, Diamond, Selenite, Amethyst, Chrysoberyl) — species that live between petals

---

### PART II: CHARACTER CREATION (Pages 11–24) — The Heart of the Book

**Pages 11–12: The Philosophical Architecture**
- The hierarchy: Senses (5 dice) → Mind (D10) → Intelligence (D100) → Wealth (D2)
- Bhagavad Gita 3.42: senses → mind → intelligence → soul
- The three-stage arc: Sense Mastery → Mind Submission → Wealth Generation
- "This is not just character creation. It is a ritual of becoming."

**Pages 13–14: The Godz World Egg — Step by Step**
- Prepare the ritual: gather 6 dice, note the date/time/location (Birth Moment)
- Roll all 6 simultaneously. Record each result. Sum and add to running total.
- Repeat until total reaches 360°
- Ghost Lock Threshold (333°): strategic dice selection begins
- ~11 sets, ~66 individual rolls, ~15 minutes at the table

**Pages 15–16: Calculating Your Character**
- Elemental Composition: sum per die / (die max × sets)
- Karma: total rolled / total possible
- Opulence Points: 1–5 based on karma bracket
- Ability Scores: element % × 20 (1–20 scale)
- Speed: number of sets
- Power: total degrees (overshoot)

**Pages 17–18: The Two Emergent Stats**
- **Order (D100/Intelligence/Focus):** Initial = Karma × 100. Grows through study, pattern recognition, teaching. Decays through willful ignorance.
- **Wealth (D2/Instinct/Ownership):** Flow if Renunciation OP > 0, Scarcity if = 0. Flips through gameplay via reciprocity/hoarding.
- Why these aren't rolled: the game teaches that intelligence emerges from sensing, and wealth emerges from renunciation. You can't roll yourself into wisdom or wealth. You earn them.

**Pages 19–20: The Six Opulences**
- Distribute OP across: Strength (Bala), Beauty (Shri), Fame (Yashas), Knowledge (Jnana), Wealth (Aishvarya), Renunciation (Vairagya)
- Water and Earth opulences are community-discoverable (the design koan)
- Your first moral act: where you put your points reveals who you aspire to be
- Placing any OP in Renunciation → Wealth begins in Flow. The paradox of abundance.

**Pages 21–22: The Birth Hexagram (Numerology)**
- Reading your final GWE set as a hexagram (yin/yang per die based on median)
- Lower trigram (D4+D6+D8) = Material Nature → Petal
- Upper trigram (D10+D12+D20) = Subtle Nature → Species
- 64 hexagrams = 64 species. The species EMERGES from the roll.
- Personal Resonance Numbers: the mode of each die across all GWE sets

**Pages 23–24: The Birth Sky (Astrology)**
- Set Stellarium to your Birth Moment
- Record star signs from 2+ cultural traditions (Western zodiac + one other)
- Moon phase effects on GWE
- Star Affinity: dominant planet at birth → element narrative affinity
- The pluriversal principle: same sky, many readings, all true

---

### PART III: PLAYING THE GAME (Pages 25–36)

**Pages 25–26: The Attainment System**
- Core resolution: roll the relevant element's die → attainment = roll / die_max
- All dice are equal: 3/4 on D4 = 15/20 on D20 = 75% attainment
- Difficulty thresholds: Easy (25%+), Moderate (50%+), Hard (75%+), Legendary (90%+)
- The GM decides which element applies. "This is a test of Empathy" → roll D20.

**Pages 27–28: Numerological Resonance**
- Tier 1 (Universal): invoke a number's cross-cultural meaning → failure becomes partial success
- Tier 2 (Personal): roll your resonance number on the matching die → automatic partial/full success
- Tier 3 (Hexagram): all 6 dice match your Birth Hexagram → cosmic alignment, narrative takeover
- Guidelines: the table adjudicates, not just the GM. Narrative must be genuine.

**Pages 29–30: The Emergent Checks**
- **Order Check (D100):** Roll D100 ≤ your Order score to succeed. For intelligence, focus, pattern recognition.
- **Wealth Check (D2/Coin Flip):** In Flow, succeed on either result. In Scarcity, succeed only on Heads (2).
- Order grows through play. Wealth flips through choices. Both track the player's developmental arc.

**Pages 31–32: Combat**
- Attainment-based combat: each combatant rolls their primary element's die
- Higher attainment wins the exchange
- Crystal Shard arsenal: weapons and armor generated from the character's shard
- Elemental advantage/disadvantage (the TEK8 cycle of creation and destruction)
- HP = derived from Endurance (Earth) and elemental composition

**Pages 33–34: Magic — The Six Opulences as Magical Channels**
- Magic derives from the Opulences, not from separate "spell slots"
- Strength (Bala) → physical enhancement, barriers, force projection
- Beauty (Shri) → illusion, glamour, inspiration, morale
- Fame (Yashas) → summoning (call upon reputation), sonic attacks, bardic effects
- Knowledge (Jnana) → divination, analysis, truth-seeing, wards
- Wealth (Aishvarya) → transmutation, creation, resource manifestation
- Renunciation (Vairagya) → dispelling, banishing, purification, silence
- Mana regeneration through Renunciation (detachment clears channels)

**Pages 35–36: Growth and Evolution**
- How abilities increase: through use, challenge, and teaching
- How Order increases: study, meditation, pattern recognition, teaching others
- How Wealth flips: reciprocity → Flow; hoarding → Scarcity
- Guild evolution: as elemental composition shifts through play, guild affinity may change
- Species evolution: characters can discover aspects of other species within their petal through play
- The 64 Kalās: 64 skill slots available for mastery (mirroring the 64 species, 64 hexagrams, 64 codons)

---

### PART IV: THE GAME MASTER (Pages 37–42)

**Pages 37–38: Running Dice Godz**
- The GM as "The Weaver" — not an adversary, but a pattern-maker
- Using TEK8 elements to structure sessions: which element is this session about?
- Using Stellarium for astronomical events as session hooks
- Using I Ching hexagrams for random encounter generation (roll 6 dice = encounter type)

**Pages 39–40: Building Adventures**
- The commons vs. enclosure framework: every adventure has a commons at stake
- Element-based adventure structure: each element provides a different adventure type
  - Fire: investigation/revelation
  - Earth: building/protecting
  - Air: communication/travel
  - Water: healing/relationship
  - Chaos: transformation/upheaval
  - Ether: discovery/fame
  - Order: planning/governance
  - Coin: trade/exchange
- 8 sample adventure hooks (one per element)

**Pages 41–42: NPCs and Encounters**
- Quick NPC generation: roll 6 dice = elemental composition = personality
- The Birth Hexagram as NPC generation tool (roll once, read the hexagram, instant character)
- Queen Mab as recurring quest-giver
- Faction NPCs: representatives of Freecrystal, Lattice Imperium, Null Collective
- Environmental encounters: the world itself acts based on elemental conditions

---

### PART V: THE CULTURE (Pages 43–50)

**Pages 43–44: TEK8 and Traditional Ecological Knowledge**
- What TEK is (LaDuke's definition)
- What TEK8 is and is not (invitation, not credential)
- The reciprocity obligation
- The scholars: LaDuke, Cajete, Kimmerer, Smith, Berkes
- "Human cleverness must remain subordinate to nature's wisdom." — Wes Jackson via LaDuke

**Pages 45–46: Pluriversal Game Design**
- What pluriversal means: multiple knowledge systems, none supreme
- How the game embodies it: multiple dice, multiple star signs, multiple numerological traditions, multiple species
- The Arturo Escobar influence: designs for the pluriverse
- An invitation: bring YOUR traditions to the table. If something from your heritage maps to TEK8, it belongs here.

**Pages 47–48: Cultural Sharing Guidelines**
- The LaDuke principle: authentic and reciprocal cultural sharing, not extraction
- Attribution as minimum respect
- Research beyond the game
- Reciprocity in practice: support the traditions that enrich your play
- The ninja-turtle leprechaun statement: "The author's cultural identity defies easy categorization. So might yours. Play accordingly."

**Pages 49–50: On Water and the D20**
- The Coyote & Crow question (condensed from v3.1 Part V)
- TEK8's response: no die dominates; removing Water = removing empathy
- Both approaches honor indigenous design principles
- The deeper answer: sovereignty in game design
